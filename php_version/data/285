Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Among cognitively healthy older individuals, the relationship among the 2 hallmark proteins of AD (Abeta and tau APOE epsilon4) and neurodegeneration is not well-understood. Here, we investigated the relationship between Abeta, p-tau, and APOE epsilon4 on longitudinal brain atrophy in preclinical AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 107 cognitively healthy older adults who underwent longitudinal MR imaging and baseline lumbar puncture. Within the same linear mixed-effects model, we concurrently investigated main and interactive effects between the APOE epsilon4 genotype and CSF Abeta(1-42), CSF p-tau and CSF Abeta(1-42), and the APOE epsilon4 genotype and CSF p-tau on entorhinal cortex atrophy rate. We also examined the relationship of APOE epsilon4, CSF p-tau, and CSF Abeta(1-42) on the atrophy rate of other AD-vulnerable neuroanatomic regions. RESULTS: The full model with main and interactive effects demonstrated a significant interaction only between CSF p-tau and CSF Abeta(1-42) on entorhinal cortex atrophy rate, indicating elevated atrophy with time in individuals with increased CSF p-tau and decreased CSF Abeta(1-42). The APOE epsilon4 genotype was significantly and specifically associated with CSF Abeta(1-42). However, the interaction between the APOE epsilon4 genotype and either CSF Abeta(1-42) or CSF p-tau on entorhinal cortex atrophy rate was not significant. We found similar results in other AD-vulnerable regions. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our findings and building on prior experimental evidence, we propose a model of the pathogenic cascade underlying preclinical AD in which APOE epsilon4 primarily influences the pathology of Alzheimer disease via Abeta-related mechanisms, and in turn, Abeta-associated neurodegeneration occurs only in the presence of p-tau.

Abstract: Atrophic changes in early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been proposed as biomarkers for detection and monitoring. We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) atrophy rate from baseline to 1 year in 4 groups of participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): AD (n = 152), converters from MCI to probable AD (MCI-C, n = 60), stable MCI (MCI-S, n = 261), and healthy controls (HC, n = 200). Scans were analyzed using multiple methods, including voxel-based morphometry (VBM), regions of interest (ROIs), and automated parcellation, permitting comparison of annual percent change (APC) in neurodegeneration markers. Effect sizes and the sample required to detect 25% reduction in atrophy rates were calculated. The influence of APOE genotype on APC was also evaluated. AD patients and converters from MCI to probable AD demonstrated high atrophy APCs across regions compared with minimal change in healthy controls. Stable MCI subjects showed intermediate atrophy rates. APOE genotype was associated with APC in key regions. In sum, APC rates are influenced by APOE genotype, imminent MCI to AD conversion, and AD-related neurodegeneration.

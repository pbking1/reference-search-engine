Abstract: Cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta 1-42 (Abeta1-42) and phosphorylated Tau at position 181 (pTau181) are biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We performed an analysis and meta-analysis of genome-wide association study data on Abeta1-42 and pTau181 in AD dementia patients followed by independent replication. An association was found between Abeta1-42 level and a single-nucleotide polymorphism in SUCLG2 (rs62256378) (P = 2.5x10-12). An interaction between APOE genotype and rs62256378 was detected (P = 9.5 x 10-5), with the strongest effect being observed in APOE-epsilon4 noncarriers. Clinically, rs62256378 was associated with rate of cognitive decline in AD dementia patients (P = 3.1 x 10-3). Functional microglia experiments showed that SUCLG2 was involved in clearance of Abeta1-42.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to evaluate the association of APOE with amyloid deposition, cerebrospinal fluid levels (CSF) of Abeta, tau, and p-tau, brain atrophy, cognition and cognitive complaints in E-MCI patients and cognitively healthy older adults (HC) in the ADNI-2 cohort. METHODS: Two-hundred and nine E-MCI and 123 HC participants from the ADNI-2 cohort were included. We evaluated the impact of diagnostic status (E-MCI vs. HC) and APOE epsilon4 status (epsilon4 positive vs. epsilon4 negative) on cortical amyloid deposition (AV-45/Florbetapir SUVR PET scans), brain atrophy (structural MRI scans processed using voxel-based morphometry and Freesurfer version 5.1), CSF levels of Abeta, tau, and p-tau, and cognitive performance and complaints. RESULTS: E-MCI participants showed significantly impaired cognition, higher levels of cognitive complaints, greater levels of tau and p-tau, and subcortical and cortical atrophy relative to HC participants (p < 0.05). Cortical amyloid deposition and CSF levels of Abeta were significantly associated with APOE epsilon4 status but not E-MCI diagnosis, with epsilon4 positive participants showing more amyloid deposition and lower levels of CSF Abeta than epsilon4 negative participants. Other effects of APOE epsilon4 status on cognition and CSF tau levels were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: APOE epsilon4 status is associated with amyloid accumulation and lower CSF Abeta, as well as increased CSF tau levels in early prodromal stages of AD (E-MCI) and HC. Alternatively, neurodegeneration, cognitive impairment, and increased complaints are primarily associated with a diagnosis of E-MCI. These findings underscore the importance of considering APOE genotype when evaluating biomarkers in early stages of disease.

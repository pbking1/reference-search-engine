Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To examine whether beta-amyloid (Abeta) and APOE epsilon4 status independently contribute or interact to influence longitudinal cognitive decline in clinically normal older individuals (CN). METHODS: Data from 490 CNs were aggregated across 3 observational cohort studies (Harvard Aging Brain Study, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing; median age = 75.0 years, 255 female), and the contributions of APOE epsilon4 and Abeta on longitudinal change over a median of 1.49 years were examined. Cognitive decline was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Logical Memory (immediate and delayed recall scores). RESULTS: High Abeta participants were more likely to be APOE epsilon4+ than low Abeta participants. CNs who were both high Abeta and APOE epsilon4+ showed greater decline in Logical Memory immediate recall (p < 0.087), Logical Memory delayed recall (p < 0.024), and MMSE (p < 0.034) compared to all other groups (low Abeta/APOE epsilon4-, low Abeta/APOE epsilon4+, and high Abeta/APOE epsilon4-). No other pairwise contrast was significant for any cognitive measure. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically normal individuals who are APOE epsilon4+ and have high Abeta showed the highest cognitive decline. These results suggest that Abeta and APOE epsilon4 are not redundant contributors of decline in aging but rather interact to promote decline during the short follow-up period examined in this study. Longer follow-up periods will be essential to fully elucidate the influence of Alzheimer disease risk factors on cognitive decline in aging.

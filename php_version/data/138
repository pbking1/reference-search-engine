Abstract: This article summarizes a special series of articles from The Advanced Psychometric Methods in Cognitive Aging Research conference, held in June, 2011 at Friday Harbor, Washington. This conference used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to address cognitive change associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and how it related to neuroimaging, genetic, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers. The 13 articles in this series present innovative approaches to measuring cognition and studying determinants of cognitive decline in AD.

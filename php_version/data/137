Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Disease State Index (DSI) is a method which interprets data originating from multiple different sources, assisting the clinician in the diagnosis and follow-up of dementia diseases. OBJECTIVE: We compared the differences in accuracy in differentiating stable mild cognitive impairment (S-MCI) and progressive MCI (P-MCI) obtained from different data combinations using the DSI. METHODS: We investigated 212 cases with S-MCI and 165 cases with P-MCI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Data from neuropsychological tests, cerebrospinal fluid, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) were included. RESULTS: The combination of all parameters gave the highest accuracy (accuracy 0.70, sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.68). In the different categories, neuropsychological tests (0.65, 0.65, 0.65) and hippocampal volumetry (0.66, 0.66, 0.66) achieved the highest accuracy. CONCLUSION: In addition to neuropsychological testing, MRI is recommended to be included for differentiating S-MCI from P-MCI. APOE genotype, CSF and PET may provide some additional information.

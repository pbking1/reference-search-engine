This development is motivated by performing searches for associations between genetic variants and brain imaging phenotypes. GLRR integrates a low rank matrix to approximate the high-dimensional regression coefficient matrix of GLRR and a dynamic factor model to model the high-dimensional covariance matrix of brain imaging phenotypes. Local hypothesis testing is developed to identify significant covariates on high-dimensional responses. Posterior computation proceeds via an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. A simulation study is performed to evaluate the finite sample performance of GLRR and its comparison with several competing approaches. We apply GLRR to investigate the impact of 1,071 SNPs on top 40 genes reported by AlzGene database on the volumes of 93 regions of interest (ROI) obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). :: Notes: Zhu, Hongtu :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25349462 :: Author Address: H.

Precisely, we compare our three recent proposed feature selection methods [i.e., multiple kernel learning (MKL), high-order graph matching based feature selection (HGM-FS), sparse multimodal learning (SMML)] using four widely-used modalities [i.e., magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and genetic modality single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)]. This study demonstrates the performance of each method using these modalities individually or integratively, and may be valuable to clinical tests in practice. Our experimental results suggest that for AD prediction, in general, (1) in terms of accuracy, PET is the best modality; (2) Even though the discriminant power of genetic SNP features is weak, adding this modality to other modalities does help improve the classification accuracy; (3) HGM-FS works best among the three feature selection methods; (4) Some of the selected features are shared by all the feature selection methods, which may have high correlation with the disease. Using all the modalities on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, the best accuracies, described as (mean +/- standard deviation)%, among the three methods are (76.2 +/- 11.3)% for AD vs. MCI, (94.8 +/- 7.3)% for AD vs. HC, (76.5 +/- 11.1)% for MCI vs. HC, and (71.0 +/- 8.4)% for AD vs. MCI vs. HC, respectively. :: Notes: Zhang, Ziming :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25368574 :: Author Address: Department of Radiology and Biomedical Research Imaging Center, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Chapel Hill, NC, USA.

For example, in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), in addition to genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), thousands of neuroimaging and neuropsychological phenotypes as intermediate phenotypes for Alzheimer's disease, have been collected. Although some classic methods like MANOVA and newly proposed methods may be applied, they have their own limitations. For example, MANOVA cannot be applied to binary and other discrete traits. In addition, the relationships among these methods are not well understood. Importantly, since these tests are not data adaptive, depending on the unknown association patterns among multiple traits and between multiple traits and a locus, these tests may or may not be powerful. In this paper we propose a class of data-adaptive weights and the corresponding weighted tests in the general framework of generalized estimation equations (GEE). A highly adaptive test is proposed to select the most powerful one from this class of the weighted tests so that it can maintain high power across a wide range of situations. Our proposed tests are applicable to various types of traits with or without covariates. Importantly, we also analytically show relationships among some existing and our proposed tests, indicating that many existing tests are special cases of our proposed tests. Extensive simulation studies were conducted to compare and contrast the power properties of various existing and our new methods. Finally, we applied the methods to an ADNI dataset to illustrate the performance of the methods. We conclude with the recommendation for the use of the GEE-based Score test and our proposed adaptive test for their high and complementary performance. :: Notes: Zhang, Yiwei :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704269 :: Author Address: Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA.

Data from 63 subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative aMCI cohort who had MRI and FDG-PET imaging along with CSF data at baseline and at least two years clinical follow-up were used. A Bayesian classification method was used to determine which combination of 31 variables (MRI, FDG-PET, CSF measurements, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype, and cognitive scores) provided the most accurate prediction of aMCI to AD conversion. The cost and time trade-offs for the use of these biomarkers as inclusion criteria in clinical trials were evaluated. Using the combination of all biomarkers, ApoE genotype, and cognitive scores, we achieved an accuracy of 81% in predicting aMCI to AD conversion. With only ApoE genotype and cognitive scores, the prediction accuracy decreased to 62%. By comparing individual modalities, we found that MRI measures had the best predictive power (accuracy = 78%), followed by ApoE, FDG-PET, CSF, and the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale. The combination of biomarkers from different modalities, measuring complementary aspects of AD pathology, provided the most accurate prediction of aMCI to AD conversion within two years. This was predominantly driven by MRI measures, which emerged as the single most powerful modality. Overall, the combination of MRI, ApoE, and cognitive scores provided the best trade-off between cost and time compared with other biomarker combinations for patient recruitment in clinical trial. :: Notes: Yu, Peng :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22796873 :: Author Address: Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, IN, USA. yu_peng_py@lilly.com

Clinical :: ISSN: 2213-1582 (Electronic) :: PMCID: 3777690 :: Accession Number: 24179825 :: Abstract: Accurately identifying the patients that have mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who will go on to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) will become essential as new treatments will require identification of AD patients at earlier stages in the disease process. Most previous work in this area has centred around the same automated techniques used to diagnose AD patients from healthy controls, by coupling high dimensional brain image data or other relevant biomarker data to modern machine learning techniques. Such studies can now distinguish between AD patients and controls as accurately as an experienced clinician. Models trained on patients with AD and control subjects can also distinguish between MCI patients that will convert to AD within a given timeframe (MCI-c) and those that remain stable (MCI-s), although differences between these groups are smaller and thus, the corresponding accuracy is lower. The most common type of classifier used in these studies is the support vector machine, which gives categorical class decisions. In this paper, we introduce Gaussian process (GP) classification to the problem. This fully Bayesian method produces naturally probabilistic predictions, which we show correlate well with the actual chances of converting to AD within 3 years in a population of 96 MCI-s and 47 MCI-c subjects. Furthermore, we show that GPs can integrate multimodal data (in this study volumetric MRI, FDG-PET, cerebrospinal fluid, and APOE genotype with the classification process through the use of a mixed kernel). The GP approach aids combination of different data sources by learning parameters automatically from training data via type-II maximum likelihood, which we compare to a more conventional method based on cross validation and an SVM classifier. When the resulting probabilities from the GP are dichotomised to produce a binary classification, the results for predicting MCI conversion based on the combination of all three types of data show a balanced accuracy of 74%. This is a substantially higher accuracy than could be obtained using any individual modality or using a multikernel SVM, and is competitive with the highest accuracy yet achieved for predicting conversion within three years on the widely used ADNI dataset. :: Notes: Young, Jonathan :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24179825 :: Author Address: Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London, UK.

We enhanced the recently introduced event-based model for use with a multi-modal sporadic disease data set. This allows us to determine the sequence in which Alzheimer's disease biomarkers become abnormal without reliance on a priori clinical diagnostic information or explicit biomarker cut points. The model also characterizes the uncertainty in the ordering and provides a natural patient staging system. Two hundred and eighty-five subjects (92 cognitively normal, 129 mild cognitive impairment, 64 Alzheimer's disease) were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with measurements of 14 Alzheimer's disease-related biomarkers including cerebrospinal fluid proteins, regional magnetic resonance imaging brain volume and rates of atrophy measures, and cognitive test scores. We used the event-based model to determine the sequence of biomarker abnormality and its uncertainty in various population subgroups. We used patient stages assigned by the event-based model to discriminate cognitively normal subjects from those with Alzheimer's disease, and predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment. The model predicts that cerebrospinal fluid levels become abnormal first, followed by rates of atrophy, then cognitive test scores, and finally regional brain volumes. In amyloid-positive (cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-beta1-42 < 192 pg/ml) or APOE-positive (one or more APOE4 alleles) subjects, the model predicts with high confidence that the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers become abnormal in a distinct sequence: amyloid-beta1-42, phosphorylated tau, total tau. However, in the broader population total tau and phosphorylated tau are found to be earlier cerebrospinal fluid markers than amyloid-beta1-42, albeit with more uncertainty. The model's staging system strongly separates cognitively normal and Alzheimer's disease subjects (maximum classification accuracy of 99%), and predicts conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (maximum balanced accuracy of 77% over 3 years), and from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (maximum balanced accuracy of 76% over 5 years). By fitting Cox proportional hazards models, we find that baseline model stage is a significant risk factor for conversion from both mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (P = 2.06 x 10(-7)) and cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment (P = 0.033). The data-driven model we describe supports hypothetical models of biomarker ordering in amyloid-positive and APOE-positive subjects, but suggests that biomarker ordering in the wider population may diverge from this sequence. The model provides useful disease staging information across the full spectrum of disease progression, from cognitively normal to mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. This approach has broad application across neurodegenerative disease, providing insights into disease biology, as well as staging and prognostication. :: Notes: Young, Alexandra L :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25012224 :: Author Address: 1 Centre for Medical Image Computing, Department of Computer Science, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, UK alexandra.young.11@ucl.ac.uk.

The goal of this study is to report indices of sleep-wake function collected from individuals with AD in relation to relevant polymorphisms in circadian clock-related genes. DESIGN: One week of ad libitum ambulatory sleep data collection. SETTING: At-home collection of sleep data and in-laboratory questionnaire. PARTICIPANTS: Two cohorts of AD participants. Cohort 1 (N = 124): individuals with probable AD recruited from the Stanford/Veterans Affairs, National Institute on Aging Alzheimer's Disease Core Center (N = 81), and the Memory Disorders Clinic at the University of Nice School of Medicine (N = 43). Cohort 2 (N = 176): individuals with probable AD derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set. MEASUREMENTS: Determination of sleep-wake state was obtained by wrist actigraphy data for 7 days in Cohort 1 and by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory questionnaire for Cohort 2. Both cohorts were genotyped by using an Illumina Beadstation (Illumina, San Diego, CA), and 122 circadian-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were examined. In Cohort 1, an additional polymorphism (variable-number tandem repeat in per3) was also determined. RESULTS: Adjusting for multiple tests, none of the candidate gene SNPs were significantly associated with the amount of wake time after sleep onset (WASO), a marker of sleep consolidation. Although the study was powered sufficiently to identify moderate-sized correlations, we found no relationships likely to be of clinical relevance. CONCLUSIONS: It is unlikely that a relationship with a clinically meaningful correlation exists between the circadian rhythm-associated SNPs and WASO in individuals with AD. :: Notes: Yesavage, Jerome A :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21709609 :: Author Address: Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care System, Stanford University School of Medicine, Palo Alto, California. yesavage@stanford.edu

Identifying MCI individuals with high likelihood of conversion to dementia and the associated biosignatures has recently received increasing attention in AD research. Different biosignatures for AD (neuroimaging, demographic, genetic and cognitive measures) may contain complementary information for diagnosis and prognosis of AD. METHODS: We have conducted a comprehensive study using a large number of samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to test the power of integrating various baseline data for predicting the conversion from MCI to probable AD and identifying a small subset of biosignatures for the prediction and assess the relative importance of different modalities in predicting MCI to AD conversion. We have employed sparse logistic regression with stability selection for the integration and selection of potential predictors. Our study differs from many of the other ones in three important respects: (1) we use a large cohort of MCI samples that are unbiased with respect to age or education status between case and controls (2) we integrate and test various types of baseline data available in ADNI including MRI, demographic, genetic and cognitive measures and (3) we apply sparse logistic regression with stability selection to ADNI data for robust feature selection. RESULTS: We have used 319 MCI subjects from ADNI that had MRI measurements at the baseline and passed quality control, including 177 MCI Non-converters and 142 MCI Converters. Conversion was considered over the course of a 4-year follow-up period. A combination of 15 features (predictors) including those from MRI scans, APOE genotyping, and cognitive measures achieves the best prediction with an AUC score of 0.8587. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate the power of integrating various baseline data for prediction of the conversion from MCI to probable AD. Our results also demonstrate the effectiveness of stability selection for feature selection in the context of sparse logistic regression. :: Notes: Ye, Jieping :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22731740 :: Author Address: Center for Evolutionary Medicine and Informatics, The Biodesign Institute, Arizona, State University, Tempe, AZ, USA. jieping.ye@asu.edu

However, quantifying the continuous trajectories proposed by these models over time is difficult because of the difficulty in relating the dynamics of different biomarkers during a clinical trial that is significantly shorter than the duration of the disease. We seek to show that through proper synchronization, it is possible to de-convolve these trends and quantify the periods of time associated with different pathophysiological changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We developed a model that replicated the observed progression of ADAS-Cog 13 scores and used this as a more precise estimate of disease-duration and thus pathologic stage. We then synchronized cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and imaging biomarkers according to our new disease timeline. By de-convolving disease progression via ADAS-Cog 13, we were able to confirm the predictions of previous hypothetical models of disease progression as well as establish concrete timelines for different pathobiological events. Specifically, our work supports a sequential pattern of biomarker changes in AD in which reduction in CSF Abeta(42) and brain atrophy precede the increases in CSF tau and phospho-tau. :: Notes: Yang, Eric :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21694449 :: Author Address: Johnson and Johnson, PRDUS.

The major task is to examine the association between genetic markers such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and quantitative traits (QTs) extracted from neuroimaging data. The complexity of these datasets has presented critical bioinformatics challenges that require new enabling tools. Sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) is a bi-multivariate technique used in imaging genetics to identify complex multi-SNP-multi-QT associations. However, most of the existing SCCA algorithms are designed using the soft thresholding method, which assumes that the input features are independent from one another. This assumption clearly does not hold for the imaging genetic data. In this article, we propose a new knowledge-guided SCCA algorithm (KG-SCCA) to overcome this limitation as well as improve learning results by incorporating valuable prior knowledge. RESULTS: The proposed KG-SCCA method is able to model two types of prior knowledge: one as a group structure (e.g. linkage disequilibrium blocks among SNPs) and the other as a network structure (e.g. gene co-expression network among brain regions). The new model incorporates these prior structures by introducing new regularization terms to encourage weight similarity between grouped or connected features. A new algorithm is designed to solve the KG-SCCA model without imposing the independence constraint on the input features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm with both synthetic and real data. For real data, using an Alzheimer's disease (AD) cohort, we examine the imaging genetic associations between all SNPs in the APOE gene (i.e. top AD gene) and amyloid deposition measures among cortical regions (i.e. a major AD hallmark). In comparison with a widely used SCCA implementation, our KG-SCCA algorithm produces not only improved cross-validation performances but also biologically meaningful results.

On the other hand, longitudinal studies, such as Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), collect phenotypic information at multiple time points. In this article, as a case study, we conducted both longitudinal and cross-sectional analyses of the ADNI data with several brain imaging (not clinical diagnosis) phenotypes, demonstrating the power gains of longitudinal analysis over cross-sectional analysis. Specifically, we scanned genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with 56 brain-wide imaging phenotypes processed by FreeSurfer on 638 subjects. At the genome-wide significance level ([Formula: see text]) or a less stringent level (e.g. [Formula: see text]), longitudinal analysis of the phenotypic data from the baseline to month 48 identified more SNP-phenotype associations than cross-sectional analysis of only the baseline data. In particular, at the genome-wide significance level, both SNP rs429358 in gene APOE and SNP rs2075650 in gene TOMM40 were confirmed to be associated with various imaging phenotypes in multiple regions of interests (ROIs) by both analyses, though longitudinal analysis detected more regional phenotypes associated with the two SNPs and indicated another significant SNP rs439401 in gene APOE. In light of the power advantage of longitudinal analysis, we advocate its use in current and future longitudinal neuroimaging studies. :: Notes: Xu, Zhiyuan :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25098835 :: Author Address: Division of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States of America.

In the study of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), neuroimaging data, gene/protein expression data, etc., are often analyzed together to improve predictive power. Joint learning from multiple complementary data sources is advantageous, but feature-pruning and data source selection are critical to learn interpretable models from high-dimensional data. Often, the data collected has block-wise missing entries. In the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), most subjects have MRI and genetic information, but only half have cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures, a different half has FDG-PET; only some have proteomic data. Here we propose how to effectively integrate information from multiple heterogeneous data sources when data is block-wise missing. We present a unified "bi-level" learning model for complete multi-source data, and extend it to incomplete data. Our major contributions are: (1) our proposed models unify feature-level and source-level analysis, including several existing feature learning approaches as special cases; (2) the model for incomplete data avoids imputing missing data and offers superior performance; it generalizes to other applications with block-wise missing data sources; (3) we present efficient optimization algorithms for modeling complete and incomplete data.

Given the availability of multiple data sources (referred to as multi-indices), such as multimodal neuroimaging data sets, cognitive tests, and clinical ratings and genomic data in Alzheimer's disease (AD) studies, the single-index-based ROC underutilizes all available information. For a long time, a number of algorithmic/analytic approaches combining multiple indices have been widely used to simultaneously incorporate multiple sources. In this study, we propose an alternative for combining multiple indices using logical operations, such as "AND," "OR," and "at least n" (where n is an integer), to construct multivariate ROC (multiV-ROC) and characterize the sensitivity and specificity statistically associated with the use of multiple indices. With and without the "leave-one-out" cross-validation, we used two data sets from AD studies to showcase the potentially increased sensitivity/specificity of the multiV-ROC in comparison to the single-index ROC and linear discriminant analysis (an analytic way of combining multi-indices). We conclude that, for the data sets we investigated, the proposed multiV-ROC approach is capable of providing a natural and practical alternative with improved classification accuracy as compared to univariate ROC and linear discriminant analysis. :: Notes: Wu, Xia :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23702553 :: Author Address: State Key Laboratory of Cognitive Neuroscience and Learning, College of Information Science and Technology, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, P.R.

In this approach a 4D graph is used to represent the longitudinal data: edges are weighted based on spatial and intensity priors and connect spatially and temporally neighboring voxels represented by vertices in the graph. Solving the min-cut/max-flow problem on this graph yields the segmentation for all timepoints in a single step. By segmenting all timepoints simultaneously, a consistent and atrophy-sensitive segmentation is obtained. The application to hippocampal atrophy measurement in 568 image pairs (Baseline and Month 12 follow-up) as well as 362 image triplets (Baseline, Month 12, and Month 24) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) confirms previous findings for atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and healthy aging. Highly significant correlations between hippocampal atrophy and clinical variables (Mini Mental State Examination, MMSE and Clinical Dementia Rating, CDR) were found and atrophy rates differ significantly according to subjects' ApoE genotype. Based on one year atrophy rates, a correct classification rate of 82% between AD and control subjects is achieved. Subjects that converted from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to AD after the period for which atrophy was measured (i.e., after the first 12 months) and subjects for whom conversion is yet to be identified were discriminated with a rate of 64%, a promising result with a view to clinical application. Power analysis shows that 67 and 206 subjects are needed for the AD and MCI groups respectively to detect a 25% change in volume loss with 80% power and 5% significance. :: Notes: Wolz, Robin :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20382238 :: Author Address: Department of Computing, Imperial College London, London, UK. r.wolz@imperial.ac.uk

Manifold coordinates of each image capture information about structural shape and appearance and, when a phenotype exists, about the subject's clinical state. Our framework incorporates subject meta-information into the manifold learning step. Apart from gender and age, information such as genotype or a derived biomarker is often available in clinical studies and can inform the classification of a query subject. Such information, whether discrete or continuous, is used as an additional input to manifold learning, extending the Laplacian Eigenmap objective function and enriching a similarity measure derived from pairwise image similarities. The biomarkers identified with the proposed method are data-driven in contrast to a priori defined biomarkers derived from, e.g., manual or automated segmentations. They form a unified representation of both the imaging and non-imaging measurements, providing a natural use for data analysis and visualization. We test the method to classify subjects with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls enrolled in the ADNI study. Non-imaging metadata used are ApoE genotype, a risk factor associated with AD, and the CSF-concentration of Abeta(1-42), an established biomarker for AD. In addition, we use hippocampal volume as a derived imaging-biomarker to enrich the learned manifold. Our classification results compare favorably to what has been reported in a recent meta-analysis using established neuroimaging methods on the same database. :: Notes: Wolz, Robin :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22244037 :: Author Address: Medical Image Analysis Group, Department of Computing, Imperial College London, 180 Queen's Gate, London SW7 2AZ, UK. r.wolz@imperial.ac.uk

Carriers of the epsilon4 allele have been reported to have greater medial temporal lobe (MTL) pathology and poorer memory than noncarriers. Less attention has focused on whether there are domains of cognition and neuroanatomical regions more affected in noncarriers. Further, a major potential confound of prior in vivo studies is the possibility of different rates of clinical misdiagnosis for carriers vs. noncarriers. We compared phenotypic differences in cognition and topography of regional cortical atrophy of epsilon4 carriers (n = 67) vs. noncarriers (n = 24) with mild AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, restricted to those with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) molecular profile consistent with AD. Between-group comparisons were made for psychometric tests and morphometric measures of cortical thickness and hippocampal volume. Carriers displayed significantly greater impairment on measures of memory retention, whereas noncarriers were more impaired on tests of working memory, executive control, and lexical access. Consistent with this cognitive dissociation, carriers exhibited greater MTL atrophy, whereas noncarriers had greater frontoparietal atrophy. Performance deficits in particular cognitive domains were associated with disproportionate regional brain atrophy within nodes of cortical networks thought to subserve these cognitive processes. These convergent cognitive and neuroanatomic findings in individuals with a CSF molecular profile consistent with AD support the hypothesis that APOE genotype modulates the clinical phenotype of AD through influence on specific large-scale brain networks. :: Notes: Wolk, David A :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20479234 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. david.wolk@uphs.upenn.edu

We used independent component analysis (ICA) on structural MR images to derive 30 matter covariance patterns (ICs) across all participants. These ICs were used in iterative and stepwise discriminant classifier analyses to predict diagnostic classification at 24 months for CN vs. MCI, CN vs. AD, MCI vs. AD, and stable MCI (MCI-S) vs. MCI progression to AD (MCI-P). Models were cross-validated with a "leave-10-out" procedure. For CN vs. MCI, 84.7% accuracy was achieved based on cognitive performance measures, ICs, p-tau(181p), and ApoE epsilon4 status. For CN vs. AD, 94.8% accuracy was achieved based on cognitive performance measures, ICs, and p-tau(181p). For MCI vs. AD and MCI-S vs. MCI-P, models achieved 83.1% and 80.3% accuracy, respectively, based on cognitive performance measures, ICs, and p-tau(181p). ICA-derived MRI biomarkers achieve excellent diagnostic accuracy for MCI conversion, which is little improved by CSF biomarkers and ApoE epsilon4 status. :: Notes: Willette, Auriel A :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25194437 :: Author Address: Laboratory of Neurosciences, National Institute on Aging, Biomedical Research Center, 251 Bayview Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21224, USA.

This study aims to use imaging techniques and biomarker analysis to determine whether traumatic brain injury (TBI) and/or PTSD resulting from combat or other traumas increase the risk for AD and decrease cognitive reserve in Veteran subjects, after accounting for age. Using military and Department of Veterans Affairs records, 65 Vietnam War veterans with a history of moderate or severe TBI with or without PTSD, 65 with ongoing PTSD without TBI, and 65 control subjects are being enrolled in this study at 19 sites. The study aims to select subject groups that are comparable in age, gender, ethnicity, and education. Subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia are being excluded. However, a new study just beginning, and similar in size, will study subjects with TBI, subjects with PTSD, and control subjects with MCI. Baseline measurements of cognition, function, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers; magnetic resonance images (structural, diffusion tensor, and resting state blood-level oxygen dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging); and amyloid positron emission tomographic (PET) images with florbetapir are being obtained. One-year follow-up measurements will be collected for most of the baseline procedures, with the exception of the lumbar puncture, the PET imaging, and apolipoprotein E genotyping. To date, 19 subjects with TBI only, 46 with PTSD only, and 15 with TBI and PTSD have been recruited and referred to 13 clinics to undergo the study protocol. It is expected that cohorts will be fully recruited by October 2014. This study is a first step toward the design and statistical powering of an AD prevention trial using at-risk veterans as subjects, and provides the basis for a larger, more comprehensive study of dementia risk factors in veterans. :: Notes: Weiner, Michael W :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24924673 :: Author Address: Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Radiology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Medicine, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA; Department of Neurology, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA.

Myelin synthesis and maintenance are highly sensitive to cholesterol concentrations, and abnormal cholesterol levels increase the risk for various brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. We report significant associations between higher serum cholesterol (CHOL) and high-density lipoprotein levels and higher fractional anisotropy in 403 young adults (23.8 +/- 2.4 years) scanned with diffusion imaging and anatomic magnetic resonance imaging at 4 Tesla. By fitting a multi-locus genetic model within white matter areas associated with CHOL, we found that a set of 18 cholesterol-related, single-nucleotide polymorphisms implicated in Alzheimer's disease risk predicted fractional anisotropy. We focused on the single-nucleotide polymorphism with the largest individual effects, CETP (rs5882), and found that increased G-allele dosage was associated with higher fractional anisotropy and lower radial and mean diffusivities in voxel-wise analyses of the whole brain. A follow-up analysis detected white matter associations with rs5882 in the opposite direction in 78 older individuals (74.3 +/- 7.3 years). Cholesterol levels may influence white matter integrity, and cholesterol-related genes may exert age-dependent effects on the brain. :: Notes: Warstadt, Nicholus M :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24997672 :: Author Address: Imaging Genetics Center, Institute for Neuroimaging and Informatics, Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

There is growing interest in detecting genetic variants associated with such multivariate traits, especially in genome-wide studies. Random forests (RFs) classifiers, which are ensembles of decision trees, are amongst the best performing machine learning algorithms and have been successfully employed for the prioritisation of genetic variants in case-control studies. RFs can also be applied to produce gene rankings in association studies with multivariate quantitative traits, and to estimate genetic similarities measures that are predictive of the trait. However, in studies involving hundreds of thousands of SNPs and high-dimensional traits, a very large ensemble of trees must be inferred from the data in order to obtain reliable rankings, which makes the application of these algorithms computationally prohibitive. RESULTS: We have developed a parallel version of the RF algorithm for regression and genetic similarity learning tasks in large-scale population genetic association studies involving multivariate traits, called PaRFR (Parallel Random Forest Regression). Our implementation takes advantage of the MapReduce programming model and is deployed on Hadoop, an open-source software framework that supports data-intensive distributed applications. Notable speed-ups are obtained by introducing a distance-based criterion for node splitting in the tree estimation process. PaRFR has been applied to a genome-wide association study on Alzheimer's disease (AD) in which the quantitative trait consists of a high-dimensional neuroimaging phenotype describing longitudinal changes in the human brain structure. PaRFR provides a ranking of SNPs associated to this trait, and produces pair-wise measures of genetic proximity that can be directly compared to pair-wise measures of phenotypic proximity. Several known AD-related variants have been identified, including APOE4 and TOMM40. We also present experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis of a linear relationship between the number of top-ranked mutated states, or frequent mutation patterns, and an indicator of disease severity.

However, its contribution to the pathogenesis of AD remains unclear to date. Here, we addressed the role of EPHA1 in AD by investigating the influence of EPHA1 on cerebrospinal fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers in three clinical stages from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We did not detect significant association of EPHA1 with amyloid-beta deposition or tau protein. However, the A-allele in the mild cognitive impairment group remarkably prevented hippocampal atrophy (partial correlation coefficient 2.812, 95% CI 0.651 to 4.973) at two-year follow-up. Additionally, AD subjects with the A-allele displayed less atrophy and greater cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) in the right lateral occipitotemporal gyrus (volume: partial correlation coefficient 540.10, 95% CI 247.26 to 832.95; CMRgl: partial correlation coefficient 0.056, 95% CI 0.024 to 0.087) and inferior temporal gyrus (volume: partial correlation coefficient 327.98, 95% CI 11.65 to 644.31; CMRgl: partial correlation coefficient 0.055, 95% CI 0.019 to 0.091) at baseline. This study suggests EPHA1 (rs11771145) interferes with the pathological alteration of the hippocampus and the lateral occipitotemporal and inferior temporal gyri throughout the AD process, leading to a lower risk of AD.

Few studies perform regression of SNP values on phenotypic measures for examining how the SNP values change when phenotypic measures are varied. This alternative approach may have a potential to help us discover important imaging genetic associations from a different perspective. In addition, the imaging markers are often measured over time, and this longitudinal profile may provide increased power for differentiating genotype groups. How to identify the longitudinal phenotypic markers associated to disease sensitive SNPs is an important and challenging research topic. RESULTS: Taking into account the temporal structure of the longitudinal imaging data and the interrelatedness among the SNPs, we propose a novel 'task-correlated longitudinal sparse regression' model to study the association between the phenotypic imaging markers and the genotypes encoded by SNPs. In our new association model, we extend the widely used l(2,1)-norm for matrices to tensors to jointly select imaging markers that have common effects across all the regression tasks and time points, and meanwhile impose the trace-norm regularization onto the unfolded coefficient tensor to achieve low rank such that the interrelationship among SNPs can be addressed. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated by both clearly improved prediction performance in empirical evaluations and a compact set of selected imaging predictors relevant to disease sensitive SNPs.

RESULTS: To overcome this limitation, in this article, we propose a new sparse multimodal multitask learning method to reveal complex relationships from gene to brain to symptom. Our main contributions are three-fold: (i) introducing combined structured sparsity regularizations into multimodal multitask learning to integrate multidimensional heterogeneous imaging genetics data and identify multimodal biomarkers; (ii) utilizing a joint classification and regression learning model to identify disease-sensitive and cognition-relevant biomarkers; (iii) deriving a new efficient optimization algorithm to solve our non-smooth objective function and providing rigorous theoretical analysis on the global optimum convergency. Using the imaging genetics data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by clearly improved performance on predicting both cognitive scores and disease status. The identified multimodal biomarkers could predict not only disease status but also cognitive function to help elucidate the biological pathway from gene to brain structure and function, and to cognition and disease.

Traditional association studies typically employ independent and pairwise univariate analysis, which treats single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and quantitative traits (QTs) as isolated units and ignores important underlying interacting relationships between the units. New methods are proposed here to overcome this limitation. RESULTS: Taking into account the interlinked structure within and between SNPs and imaging QTs, we propose a novel Group-Sparse Multi-task Regression and Feature Selection (G-SMuRFS) method to identify quantitative trait loci for multiple disease-relevant QTs and apply it to a study in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. Built upon regression analysis, our model uses a new form of regularization, group l(2,1)-norm (G(2,1)-norm), to incorporate the biological group structures among SNPs induced from their genetic arrangement. The new G(2,1)-norm considers the regression coefficients of all the SNPs in each group with respect to all the QTs together and enforces sparsity at the group level. In addition, an l(2,1)-norm regularization is utilized to couple feature selection across multiple tasks to make use of the shared underlying mechanism among different brain regions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by both clearly improved prediction performance in empirical evaluations and a compact set of selected SNP predictors relevant to the imaging QTs.

Most previous studies identify the imaging markers without considering the brain structural correlations between neuroimaging measures. However, many neuroimaging markers interrelate and work together to reveal the cognitive functions, such that these relevant markers should be selected together as the phenotypic markers. To solve this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel network constrained feature selection (NCFS) model to identify the neuroimaging markers guided by the structural brain network, which is constructed by the sparse representation method such that the interrelations between neuroimaging features are encoded into probabilities. Our new methods are evaluated by the MRI and AV45-PET data from ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative). In all cognitive function prediction tasks, our new NCFS method outperforms other state-of-the-art regression approaches. Meanwhile, we show that the new method can select the correlated imaging markers, which are ignored by the competing approaches. © 2013 Springer-Verlag. :: Notes: Conference code: 97746 :: URL: http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84879870123&partnerID=40&md5=3fc669495428eba134b20b0805a1f0dd :: Author Address: Computer Science and Engineering, University of Texas at Arlington, Arlington, TX, United States

This study investigates the genetic effects of top candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on hippocampal shape features as quantitative traits (QTs) in a large cohort. FS+LDDMM was used to segment hippocampal surfaces from MRI scans and shape features were extracted after surface registration. Elastic net (EN) and sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) were proposed to examine SNP-QT associations, and compared with multiple regression (MR). Although similar in power, EN yielded substantially fewer predictors than MR. Detailed surface mapping of global and localized genetic effects were identified by MR and EN to reveal multi-SNP-single-QT relationships, and by SCCA to discover multi-SNP-multi-QT associations. Shape analysis identified stronger SNP-QT correlations than volume analysis. Sparse multivariate models have greater power to reveal complex SNP-QT relationships. Genetic analysis of quantitative shape features has considerable potential for enhancing mechanistic understanding of complex disorders like AD. :: Notes: Wan, Jing :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21995051 :: Author Address: Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Indiana University School of Medicine, IN, USA. wanjing@iupui.edu

Stepwise regression analyses focused on morphometric and metabolic characteristics of the episodic memory network: hippocampus, entorhinal, parahippocampal, retrosplenial, posterior cingulate, precuneus, inferior parietal, and lateral orbitofrontal cortices. In NC, hippocampal metabolism predicted learning; entorhinal metabolism predicted recognition; and hippocampal metabolism predicted recall. In MCI, thickness of the entorhinal and precuneus cortices predicted learning, while parahippocampal metabolism predicted recognition. In AD, posterior cingulate cortical thickness predicted learning, while APOE genotype predicted recognition. In the total sample, hippocampal volume and metabolism, cortical thickness of the precuneus, and inferior parietal metabolism predicted learning; hippocampal volume and metabolism, parahippocampal thickness and APOE genotype predicted recognition. Imaging methods appear complementary and differentially sensitive to memory in health and disease. Medial temporal and parietal metabolism and morphometry best explained memory variance. Medial temporal characteristics were related to learning, recall and recognition, while parietal structures only predicted learning. :: Notes: Walhovd, K B :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18838195 :: Author Address: Center for the Study of Human Cognition, Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Norway. k.b.walhovd@psykologi.uio.no

BrainPrint captures shape information of an ensemble of cortical and subcortical structures by solving the eigenvalue problem of the 2D and 3D Laplace-Beltrami operator on triangular (boundary) and tetrahedral (volumetric) meshes. This discriminative characterization enables new ways to study the similarity between brains; the focus can either be on a specific brain structure of interest or on the overall brain similarity. We highlight four applications for BrainPrint in this article: (i) subject identification, (ii) age and sex prediction, (iii) brain asymmetry analysis, and (iv) potential genetic influences on brain morphology. The properties of BrainPrint require the derivation of new algorithms to account for the heterogeneous mix of brain structures with varying discriminative power. We conduct experiments on three datasets, including over 3000 MRI scans from the ADNI database, 436 MRI scans from the OASIS dataset, and 236 MRI scans from the VETSA twin study. All processing steps for obtaining the compact representation are fully automated, making this processing framework particularly attractive for handling large datasets. :: Notes: Wachinger, Christian :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25613439 :: Author Address: Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab, MIT, USA; Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, USA.

While much work has focused on single scalar valued summaries of brain phenotype, accounting for the richness of imaging data requires a brain-wide, genome-wide search. In particular, the standard approach based on mass-univariate linear modelling (MULM) does not account for the structured patterns of correlations present in each domain. In this work, we propose sparse reduced rank regression (sRRR), a strategy for multivariate modelling of high-dimensional imaging responses (measurements taken over regions of interest or individual voxels) and genetic covariates (single nucleotide polymorphisms or copy number variations), which enforces sparsity in the regression coefficients. Such sparsity constraints ensure that the model performs simultaneous genotype and phenotype selection. Using simulation procedures that accurately reflect realistic human genetic variation and imaging correlations, we present detailed evaluations of the sRRR method in comparison with the more traditional MULM approach. In all settings considered, sRRR has better power to detect deleterious genetic variants compared to MULM. Important issues concerning model selection and connections to existing latent variable models are also discussed. This work shows that sRRR offers a promising alternative for detecting brain-wide, genome-wide associations. :: Notes: Vounou, Maria :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20624472 :: Author Address: Statistics Section, Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London, UK.

Here we discuss the application of a penalized multivariate model, sparse reduced-rank regression (sRRR), for the genome-wide detection of markers associated with voxel-wise longitudinal changes in the brain caused by Alzheimer's disease (AD). Using a sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, we performed three separate studies that each compared two groups of individuals to identify genes associated with disease development and progression. For each comparison we took a two-step approach: initially, using penalized linear discriminant analysis, we identified voxels that provide an imaging signature of the disease with high classification accuracy; then we used this multivariate biomarker as a phenotype in a genome-wide association study, carried out using sRRR. The genetic markers were ranked in order of importance of association to the phenotypes using a data re-sampling approach. Our findings confirmed the key role of the APOE and TOMM40 genes but also highlighted some novel potential associations with AD. :: Notes: Vounou, Maria :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22209813 :: Author Address: Statistics Section, Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London, UK.

Comparisons were based on intergroup discrimination, correlation with concurrent cognitive/functional changes, relationships to APOE genotype, and sample sizes for clinical trials. METHODS: We used data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study consisting of CN, aMCI, and AD cohorts with both baseline and 12-month follow-up CSF and MRI. The annual change in CSF (total-tau [t-tau], Abeta(1-42)) and MRI (change in ventricular volume) was obtained in 312 subjects (92 CN, 149 aMCI, 71 AD). RESULTS: There was no significant average annual change in either CSF biomarker in any clinical group except t-tau in CN; moreover, the annual change did not differ by clinical group in pairwise comparisons. In contrast, annual increase in ventricular volume increased in the following order, AD > aMCI > CN, and differences were significant between all clinical groups in pairwise comparisons. Ventricular volume increase correlated with concurrent worsening on cognitive/functional indices in aMCI and AD whereas evidence of a similar correlation with change in CSF measures was unclear. The annual changes in MRI differed by APOE epsilon4 status overall and among aMCI while annual changes in CSF biomarkers did not. Estimated sample sizes for clinical trials are notably less for MRI than the CSF or clinical measures. CONCLUSIONS: Unlike the CSF biomarkers evaluated, changes in serial structural MRI are correlated with concurrent change on general cognitive and functional indices in impaired subjects, track with clinical disease stage, and are influenced by APOE genotype. :: Notes: Vemuri, P :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20625167 :: Author Address: Aging and Dementia Imaging Research Laboratory, Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.

METHODS: We included all 399 subjects (109 CN, 192 aMCI, 98 AD) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study with baseline CSF and MRI scans. Structural Abnormality Index (STAND) scores, which reflect the degree of AD-like anatomic features on MRI, were computed for each subject. RESULTS: A clear epsilon4 allele dose effect was seen on CSF Abeta(1-42) levels within each clinical group. In addition, the proportion of the variability in Abeta(1-42) levels explained by APOE epsilon4 dose was significantly greater than the proportion of the variability explained by clinical diagnosis. On the other hand, the proportion of the variability in CSF t-tau and MRI atrophy explained by clinical diagnosis was greater than the proportion of the variability explained by APOE epsilon4 dose; however, this effect was only significant for STAND scores. INTERPRETATION: Low CSF Abeta(1-42) (surrogate for Abeta amyloid load) is more closely linked to the presence of APOE epsilon4 than to clinical status. In contrast, MRI atrophy (surrogate for neurodegeneration) is closely linked with cognitive impairment, whereas its association with APOE epsilon4 is weaker. The data in this paper support a model of AD in which CSF Abeta(1-42) is the earliest of the 3 biomarkers examined to become abnormal in both APOE carriers and noncarriers. :: Notes: Vemuri, Prashanthi :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20373342 :: Author Address: Aging and Dementia Imaging Research Laboratory, Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, USA.

Clinical, neuropathological, and genetic studies have suggested both overlap and divergence between the pathogenesis of CAA and the biologically related condition of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among the genetic loci associated with AD are APOE and TOMM40, a gene in close proximity to APOE. We investigate here whether variants within TOMM40 are associated with CAA-related ICH and CAA neuropathology. Using cohorts from the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we designed a comparative analysis of high-density SNP genotype data for CAA-related ICH and AD. APOE epsilon4 was associated with CAA-related ICH and AD, while APOE epsilon2 was protective in AD but a risk factor for CAA. A total of 14 SNPs within TOMM40 were associated with AD (p < 0.05 after multiple testing correction), but not CAA-related ICH (all p > 0.20); as a result, all AD-associated SNPs within TOMM40 showed heterogeneity of effect in CAA-related ICH (BD p < 0.001). Analysis of CAA neuropathology in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) and Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP), however, found that neuritic plaque, diffuse plaque burden, and vascular amyloid burden associated with all TOMM40 SNPs (p < 0.02). These results suggest that alterations in TOMM40 can promote vascular as well as plaque amyloid deposition, but not the full pathogenic pathway leading to CAA-related ICH. :: Notes: Valant, Valerie :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24323865 :: Author Address: Division of Neurocritical Care and Emergency Neurology, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.

Performance of these biomarkers for predicting conversion from MCI to Alzheimer's dementia at 2 years was evaluated in 50 late amnestic MCI subjects, 20 of whom converted. Multivariate modeling found that among individual modalities, MRI had the highest predictive accuracy (67%) which increased by 9% to 76% when combined with PIB-PET, producing the highest accuracy among any biomarker combination. Individually, PIB-PET generated the best sensitivity, and fluorodeoxyglucose PET had the lowest.

Methods: We analyzed 24 months of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data for patients with Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment-stable, and mild cognitive impairment-converter (n = 462) using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire Agitation and Aggression subscale. Magnetic resonance imaging regions of interest that correlated with Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire Agitation and Aggression subscale raw scores were included in mixed-model, repeated-measures analyses of agitation and aggression over time with age, sex, apolipoprotein E ε4 status, education, and Mini-Mental State Examination score as covariates. Results: Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire Agitation and Aggression subscale scores worsened in patients with Alzheimer's disease and in mild cognitive impairment-converter (P <.05; trend for mild cognitive impairment, P =.0518). Greater agitation and aggression severity was associated with greater atrophy of frontal, insular, amygdala, cingulate, and hippocampal regions of interest (P <.05). Mini-Mental State Examination score was significant in mixed-effect model repeated measures only in mild cognitive impairment-converters for posterior regions of interest. Demographics and apolipoprotein ε4 were not associated with agitation and aggression. Conclusions: Agitation and aggression in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment is associated with neurodegeneration affecting the anterior salience network that may reduce capacity to process and regulate behaviors properly. © 2013 The Alzheimers Association.

The Penn Biomarker Core also collaborated with other ADNI Cores to integrate data across ADNI to temporally order changes in clinical measures, imaging data, and chemical biomarkers that serve as mileposts and predictors of the conversion of normal control to MCI as well as MCI to AD, and the progression of AD. Initial CSF studies by the ADNI Biomarker Core revealed a pathological CSF biomarker signature of AD defined by the combination of Abeta1-42 and total tau (T-tau) that effectively delineates mild AD in the large multisite prospective clinical investigation conducted in ADNI. This signature appears to predict conversion from MCI to AD. Data fusion efforts across ADNI Cores generated a model for the temporal ordering of AD biomarkers which suggests that Abeta amyloid biomarkers become abnormal first, followed by changes in neurodegenerative biomarkers (CSF tau, F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography, magnetic resonance imaging) with the onset of clinical symptoms. The timing of these changes varies in individual patients due to genetic and environmental factors that increase or decrease an individual's resilience in response to progressive accumulations of AD pathologies. Further studies in ADNI will refine this model and render the biomarkers studied in ADNI more applicable to routine diagnosis and to clinical trials of disease modifying therapies. :: Notes: Trojanowski, John Q :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20451871 :: Author Address: Department of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Institute on Aging, Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA. trojanow@mail.med.upenn.edu

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that there would be an association among rates of regional brain atrophy, the CSF biomarkers Abeta(1-42), t-tau, and p-tau(181p) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 status, and that the pattern of this association would be diagnosis-specific.

Therefore, the finding of faster progression of brain atrophy in the presence of lower Abeta(1-42) levels and higher tau levels supports the hypothesis that CSF Abeta(1-42) and tau are measures of early AD pathology.

Furthermore, to assess the relative importance of imaging modalities in classification of Abeta+/Abeta- early mild cognitive impairment. METHODS: Sixty-seven ADNI-GO/2 participants with early-MCI were included. Voxel-wise anatomical shape variation measures were computed by estimating the initial diffeomorphic mapping momenta from an unbiased control template. CBF measures normalized to average motor cortex CBF were mapped onto the template space. Using partial least squares regression, we identified the structural and CBF signatures of Abeta after accounting for normal cofounding effects of age, sex, and education. RESULTS: 18F-AV45-positive early-MCIs could be identified with 83% classification accuracy, 87% positive predictive value, and 84% negative predictive value by multidisciplinary classifiers combining demographics data, ApoE epsilon4-genotype, and a multimodal MRI-based Abeta score. INTERPRETATION: Multimodal-MRI can be used to predict the amyloid status of early-MCI individuals. MRI is a very attractive candidate for the identification of inexpensive and non-invasive surrogate biomarkers of Abeta deposition. Our approach is expected to have value for the identification of individuals likely to be Abeta+ in circumstances where cost or logistical problems prevent Abeta detection using cerebrospinal fluid analysis or Abeta-PET. This can also be used in clinical settings and clinical trials, aiding subject recruitment and evaluation of treatment efficacy. Imputation of the Abeta-positivity status could also complement Abeta-PET by identifying individuals who would benefit the most from this assessment. :: Notes: Tosun, Duygu :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24729983 :: Author Address: Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California - San Francisco, San Francisco, CA USA.

METHODS: The prediction model cohort included 62 MCI subjects screened with structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and (11) C-labeled Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography (PET). We identified an anatomical shape variation-based neuroimaging predictor of brain amyloidosis and defined a structural MRI-based brain amyloidosis score (sMRI-BAS). Amyloid beta positivity (Abeta(+) ) predictive power of sMRI-BAS was validated on an independent cohort of 153 MCI patients with cerebrospinal fluid Abeta1-42 biomarker data but no amyloid PET scans. We compared the Abeta(+) predictive power of sMRI-BAS to those of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype and hippocampal volume, the 2 most relevant candidate biomarkers for the prediction of brain amyloidosis. RESULTS: Anatomical shape variations predictive of brain amyloidosis in MCI embraced a characteristic spatial pattern known for high vulnerability to Alzheimer disease pathology, including the medial temporal lobe, temporal-parietal association cortices, posterior cingulate, precuneus, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, and fornix/stria terminals. Abeta(+) prediction performance of sMRI-BAS and ApoE genotype jointly was significantly better than the performance of each predictor separately (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88 vs AUC = 0.70 and AUC = 0.81, respectively) with >90% sensitivity and specificity at 20% false-positive rate and false-negative rate thresholds. Performance of hippocampal volume as an independent predictor of brain amyloidosis in MCI was only marginally better than random chance (AUC = 0.56). INTERPRETATION: As one of the first attempts to use an imaging technique that does not require amyloid-specific radioligands for identification of individuals with brain amyloidosis, our findings could lead to development of multidisciplinary/multimodality brain amyloidosis biomarkers that are reliable, minimally invasive, and widely available. :: Notes: Tosun, Duygu :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23686534 :: Author Address: Department of Radiology and Biomedical Imaging, University of California, San Francisco, San Francisco, CA; Veterans Administration Medical Center, Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases, San Francisco, CA.

To clarify this issue, we analyzed the longitudinal CSF tau and Aβ biomarker data from 142 of the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study subjects [18 AD, 74 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 50 cognitively normal subjects (CN)]. Yearly follow-up CSF collections and studies were conducted for up to 48 months (median = 36 months) for CSF Aβ1-42, phosphorylated tau (p-tau 181), and total tau (t-tau). An unsupervised analysis of longitudinal measurements revealed that for Aβ1-42 and p-tau181 biomarkers there was a group of subjects with stable longitudinal CSF biomarkers measures and a group of subjects who showed a decrease (Aβ1-42, mean = -9.2 pg/ml/year) or increase (p-tau181, mean = 5.1 pg/ml/year) of these biomarker values. Low baseline Aβ1-42 values were associated with longitudinal increases in p-tau181. Conversely, high baseline p-tau181 values were not associated with changes in Aβ1-42 levels. When the subjects with normal baseline biomarkers and stable concentrations during follow-up were excluded, the expected time to reach abnormal CSF levels and the mean AD values was significantly shortened. Thus, our data demonstrate for the first time that there are distinct populations of ADNI subjects with abnormal longitudinal changes in CSF p-tau181 and Aβ1-42 levels, and our longitudinal results favor the hypothesis that Aβ1-42 changes precede p-tau181 changes. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. :: Notes: Cited By (since 1996):5 :: URL: http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84888201046&partnerID=40&md5=4760f2336dd52f7db783aac007ffa358 :: Author Address: Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute on Aging, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, United States

Although the core cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers amyloid beta peptide 1-42 (Abeta1-42), total tau (t-tau) and phosphorylated tau 181 (p-tau181) show good diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, additional biomarkers that can aid in preclinical diagnosis or better track disease progression are needed. Activation of the complement system, a pivotal part of inflammation, occurs at very early stages in the AD brain. Therefore, CSF levels of complement proteins that could be linked to cognitive and structural changes in AD may have diagnostic and prognostic value. METHODS: Using xMAP(R) technology based assays we measured complement 3 (C3) and factor H (FH) in the CSF of 110 controls (CN), 187 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 92 AD subjects of the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) at baseline. All ADNI participants underwent clinical follow-up at 12 month intervals and MCI subjects had additional visits at 6 and 18 months. The association between CSF biomarkers and different outcome measures were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard models (conversion from MCI to AD), logistic regression models (classification of clinical groups) and mixed-effects models adjusted for age, gender, education, t-tau/Abeta1-42 and APOE 4 presence (baseline and longitudinal association between biomarkers and cognitive scores). RESULTS: Although no association was found between the complement proteins and clinical diagnosis or cognitive measures, lower levels of C3 (beta = -0.12, p = 0.041) and FH (beta = -0.075, p = 0.041) were associated with faster cognitive decline in MCI subjects as measured by the AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) test. Furthermore, lower FH levels were associated with larger lateral ventricular volume (p = 0.024), which is indicative of brain atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms a lack of suitability of CSF C3 and FH as diagnostic biomarkers of AD, but points to their modest potential as prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets in cognitively impaired patients. :: Notes: Toledo, Jon B :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25478014 :: Author Address: Pathology & Laboratory Medicine, Institute on Aging, Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

However, information on clinical and biomarker correlates of Apo-E proteins is scarce. We examined the relationship of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma Apo-E protein levels, and APOE genotype to cognition and AD biomarker changes in 311 AD neuroimaging initiative subjects with CSF Apo-E measurements and 565 subjects with plasma Apo-E measurements. At baseline, higher CSF Apo-E levels were associated with higher total and phosphorylated CSF tau levels. CSF Apo-E levels were associated with longitudinal cognitive decline, MCI conversion to dementia, and gray matter atrophy rate in total tau/Abeta1-42 ratio and APOE genotype-adjusted analyses. In analyses stratified by APOE genotype, our results were only significant in the group without the epsilon4 allele. Baseline CSF Apo-E levels did not predict longitudinal CSF Abeta or tau changes. Plasma Apo-E levels show a mild correlation with CSF Apo-E levels, but were not associated with longitudinal cognitive and MRI changes. Based on our analyses, we speculate that increased CSF Apo-E2 or -E3 levels might represent a protective response to injury in AD and may have neuroprotective effects by decreasing neuronal damage independent of tau and amyloid deposition in addition to its effects on amyloid clearance. :: Notes: Toledo, Jon B :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24385135 :: Author Address: Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute on Aging, Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, HUP, Maloney 3rd, 36th and Spruce Streets, Philadelphia, PA, 19104-4283, USA.

However, only recently multi-analyte panels to study a large number of molecules in well characterized cohorts have been made available. These panels could help identify molecules that point to the affected pathways. We studied the relationship between a panel of plasma biomarkers (Human DiscoveryMAP®) and presence of AD-like brain atrophy patterns defined by a previously published index (SPARE-AD) at baseline in subjects of the ADNI cohort. 818 subjects had MRI-derived SPARE-AD scores, of these subjects 69% had plasma biomarkers and 51% had CSF tau and Aβ measurements. Significant analyte-SPARE-AD and analytes correlations were studied in adjusted models. Plasma cortisol and chromogranin A showed a significant association that did not remain significant in the CSF signature adjusted model. Plasma macrophage inhibitory protein-1α and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 showed a significant association with brain atrophy in the adjusted model. Cortisol levels showed an inverse association with tests measuring processing speed. Our results indicate that stress and insulin responses and cytokines associated with recruitment of inflammatory cells in MCI-AD are associated with its characteristic AD-like brain atrophy pattern and correlate with clinical changes or CSF biomarkers. © 2013 Toledo et al. :: Notes: Cited By (since 1996):5 :: URL: http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84873690493&partnerID=40&md5=3b2f83a724146f2a0b6ca968a53701cb :: Author Address: Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute on Aging, Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA, United States

However, the standard experimental designs used in psychiatric research are not ideal for this purpose. The authors review the limitations of the most commonly employed designs in studies that make developmental or lifespan inferences in psychiatry: cross-sectional, single-cohort longitudinal, and unstructured multicohort longitudinal designs. Cross-sectional studies completely confound within- and between-subject sources of variation and hence rely on the presence of parallel trajectories and negligible sampling and age cohort differences for making valid developmental inferences. Delineating trajectories of within-individual change over substantial periods of time requires data covering long age spans that often cannot be covered using single-cohort longitudinal designs. Unstructured multicohort longitudinal designs are a commonly used alternative that can cover a longer age span in a shorter interval than necessary for a single-cohort design. However, the impact of cohort and sampling effects is often minimized or ignored in unstructured multicohort longitudinal designs. The authors propose that structured multicohort longitudinal designs are a particularly viable and underutilized class of designs in psychiatry that represents a significant improvement over cross-sectional designs and unstructured multicohort longitudinal designs for making developmental inferences while being more practical to implement than single-cohort longitudinal designs. As an example of this approach, the authors analyze changes in entorhinal cortex thickness in Alzheimer's disease in relation to APOE-epsilon4 genotype. :: Notes: Thompson, Wesley K :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21724665 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, Calif., USA.

Organized into Working Groups that tackle questions in neuroscience, genetics, and medicine, ENIGMA studies have analyzed neuroimaging data from over 12,826 subjects. In addition, data from 12,171 individuals were provided by the CHARGE consortium for replication of findings, in a total of 24,997 subjects. By meta-analyzing results from many sites, ENIGMA has detected factors that affect the brain that no individual site could detect on its own, and that require larger numbers of subjects than any individual neuroimaging study has currently collected. ENIGMA's first project was a genome-wide association study identifying common variants in the genome associated with hippocampal volume or intracranial volume. Continuing work is exploring genetic associations with subcortical volumes (ENIGMA2) and white matter microstructure (ENIGMA-DTI). Working groups also focus on understanding how schizophrenia, bipolar illness, major depression and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affect the brain. We review the current progress of the ENIGMA Consortium, along with challenges and unexpected discoveries made on the way. :: Notes: Thompson, Paul M :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24399358 :: Author Address: Imaging Genetics Center, Institute for Neuroimaging and Informatics, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, 2001 N.

Although this novel variant is associated with a small effect size and is unlikely to be useful as a predictor of AD risk, it might provide insights into AD pathogenesis. We examined the association between rs3818361 and brain amyloid deposition in nondemented older individuals. METHODS: We used (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography to quantify brain amyloid burden in 57 nondemented older individuals (mean age 78.5 years) in the neuroimaging substudy of the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. In a replication study, we analyzed (11)C-Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography data from 22 cognitively normal older individuals (mean age 77.1 years) in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. RESULTS: Risk allele carriers of rs3818361 have lower brain amyloid burden relative to noncarriers. There is a strikingly greater variability in brain amyloid deposition in the noncarrier group relative to risk carriers, an effect explained partly by APOE genotype. In noncarriers of the CR1 risk allele, APOE epsilon4 individuals showed significantly higher brain amyloid burden relative to APOE epsilon4 noncarriers. We also independently replicate our observation of lower brain amyloid burden in risk allele carriers of rs3818361 in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative sample. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest complex mechanisms underlying the interaction of CR1, APOE, and brain amyloid pathways in AD. Our results are relevant to treatments targeting brain Abeta in nondemented individuals at risk for AD and suggest that clinical outcomes of such treatments might be influenced by complex gene-gene interactions. :: Notes: Thambisetty, Madhav :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23022416 :: Author Address: Laboratory of Behavioral Neuroscience, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA. thambisettym@mail.nih.gov

Here, we examined cross-sectional associations between plasma ApoE levels and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging indices of the hippocampus from 541 participants [57 with normal cognition (NC), 375 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 109 with mild AD] who were enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Across the NC and MCI groups, lower plasma ApoE levels were significantly correlated with smaller hippocampal size, as measured by either hippocampal volume or hippocampal radial distance. These associations were driven primarily by findings from carriers of an APOE epsilon4 allele and are consistent with prior reports that lower plasma ApoE levels correlate with greater global cortical Pittsburgh Compound B retention. In this high-risk group, plasma ApoE levels may represent a peripheral marker of underlying AD neuropathology in nondemented elderly individuals. (c) 2014 S.

Novel statistical methods that are based on partially ordered set (poset) models can be used to create models that provide detailed and accurate information about performance with specific cognitive functions. This approach allows for the study of direct links between specific cognitive functions and risk of conversion to AD from MCI. It also allows for further delineation of multi-domain amnestic MCI, in relation to specific non-amnestic cognitive deficits, and the modeling of a range of episodic memory functioning levels. METHODS: From the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, conversion at 24 months of 268 MCI subjects was analyzed. It was found that 101 of those subjects (37.7%) converted to AD within that time frame. Poset models were then used to classify cognitive performance for MCI subjects. Respective observed conversion rates to AD were calculated for various cognitive subgroups, and by APOE e4 allele status. These rates were then compared across subgroups. RESULTS: The observed conversion rate for MCI subjects with a relatively lower functioning with a high level of episodic memory at baseline was 61.2%. In MCI subjects who additionally also had relatively lower perceptual motor speed functioning and at least one APOE e4 allele, the conversion rate was 84.2%. In contrast, the observed conversion rate was 9.8% for MCI subjects with a relatively higher episodic memory functioning level and no APOE e4 allele. Relatively lower functioning with cognitive flexibility and perceptual motor speed by itself also appears to be associated with higher conversion rates. CONCLUSIONS: Among MCI subjects, specific baseline cognitive profiles that were derived through poset modeling methods, are clearly associated with differential rates of conversion to AD. More precise delineation of MCI by such cognitive functioning profiles, including notions such as multidomain amnestic MCI, can help in gaining further insight into how heterogeneity arises in outcomes. Poset-based modeling methods may be useful for providing more precise classification of cognitive subgroups among MCI for imaging and genetics studies, and for developing more efficient and focused cognitive test batteries. :: Notes: Tatsuoka, Curtis :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23497709 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, Case Western Reserve University, 11100 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA ; Neurological Institute, University Hospitals Case Medical Center, 3619 Park East Drive, Beachwood, OH 44122 USA ; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Case Western Reserve University, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, OH 44106 USA.

We performed a gene-based association analysis of 15 quality-controlled amyloid-pathway associated candidate genes in 103 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants. The mean normalized PiB uptake value across four brain regions known to have amyloid deposition in AD was used as a quantitative phenotype. The minor allele of an intronic SNP within DHCR24 was identified and associated with a lower average PiB uptake. Further investigation at whole-brain voxel-wise level indicated that non-carriers of the minor allele had higher PiB uptake in frontal regions compared to carriers. DHCR24 has been previously shown to confer resistance against beta-amyloid and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis, thus our findings support a neuroprotective role. Pathway-based genetic analysis of targeted molecular imaging phenotypes appears promising to help elucidate disease pathophysiology and identify potential therapeutic targets. :: Notes: Swaminathan, Shanker :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21901424 :: Author Address: Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Center for Neuroimaging, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.

CNVs may encompass a single gene or multiple genes and can affect their function. They are hypothesized to play an important role in certain diseases. We previously examined the role of CNVs in late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study and identified gene regions overlapped by CNVs only in cases (AD and/or MCI) but not in controls. Using a similar approach as ADNI, we investigated the role of CNVs using 794 AD and 196 neurologically evaluated control non-Hispanic Caucasian NIA-LOAD/NCRAD Family Study participants with DNA derived from blood/brain tissue. The controls had no family history of AD and were unrelated to AD participants. CNV calls were generated and analyzed after detailed quality review. 711 AD cases and 171 controls who passed all quality thresholds were included in case/control association analyses, focusing on candidate gene and genome-wide approaches. We identified genes overlapped by CNV calls only in AD cases but not controls. A trend for lower CNV call rate was observed for deletions as well as duplications in cases compared to controls. Gene-based association analyses confirmed previous findings in the ADNI study (ATXN1, HLA-DPB1, RELN, DOPEY2, GSTT1, CHRFAM7A, ERBB4, NRXN1) and identified a new gene (IMMP2L) that may play a role in AD susceptibility. Replication in independent samples as well as further analyses of these gene regions is warranted. :: Notes: Swaminathan, Shanker :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22486522 :: Author Address: Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Center for Neuroimaging, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.

METHODS: Ninety-six Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants with [(11)C]PiB scans and plasma Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 measurements at the time of PET scanning were included. Regional and voxelwise analyses of [(11)C]PiB data were used to determine the influence of APOE epsilon4 allele on association of plasma Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42, and Abeta1-40/Abeta1-42 with [(11)C]PiB uptake. RESULTS: In APOE epsilon4- but not epsilon4+ participants, positive relationships between plasma Abeta1-40/Abeta1-42 and [(11)C]PiB uptake were observed.

To confirm the findings and identify other potential candidate regions, we analyzed array data from a unique cohort of 1617 Caucasian participants (1022 AD cases and 595 controls) who were clinically characterized and whose diagnosis was neuropathologically verified. All DNA samples were extracted from brain tissue. CNV calls were generated and subjected to quality control (QC). 728 cases and 438 controls who passed all QC measures were included in case/control association analyses including candidate gene and genome-wide approaches. Rates of deletions and duplications did not significantly differ between cases and controls. Case-control association identified a number of previously reported regions (CHRFAM7A, RELN and DOPEY2) as well as a new gene (HLA-DRA). Meta-analysis of CHRFAM7A indicated a significant association of the gene with AD and/or MCI risk (P = 0.006, odds ratio = 3.986 (95% confidence interval 1.490-10.667)).

Early detection of patients at risk of developing AD is of central importance. Blood-based genetic signatures can serve as early detection and as population-based screening tools. In this study, we aimed to identify genetic markers and gene signatures associated with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers levels of t-tau, p-tau181, and with the two ratios t-tau/Abeta1-42 and p-tau181/Abeta1-42 in the context of progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD, and to identify a panel of genetic markers that can predict CSF biomarker p-tau181/Abeta1-42 ratio with consideration of APOE4 stratification. We analyzed genome-wide the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset with up to 48 months follow-up. In the first part of the analysis, the main effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) under an additive genetic model was assessed for each of the four CSF biomarkers. In the second part of the analysis, we performed an integrated analysis of genome-wide association study results with pathway enrichment analysis, predictive modeling and network analysis in the subgroup of APOE4-negative subjects. We identified a panel of five SNPs, rs6766238, rs1143960, rs1249963, rs11975968, and rs4836493, that are predictive for p-tau181/Abeta1-42 ratio (high/low) with a sensitivity of 66% and a specificity of 70% (AUC 0.74).

The volume of the hippocampus is a biomarker of incipient Alzheimer's disease and is reduced in schizophrenia, major depression and mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. Whereas many brain imaging phenotypes are highly heritable, identifying and replicating genetic influences has been difficult, as small effects and the high costs of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have led to underpowered studies. Here we report genome-wide association meta-analyses and replication for mean bilateral hippocampal, total brain and intracranial volumes from a large multinational consortium. The intergenic variant rs7294919 was associated with hippocampal volume (12q24.22; N = 21,151; P = 6.70 x 10(-16)) and the expression levels of the positional candidate gene TESC in brain tissue. Additionally, rs10784502, located within HMGA2, was associated with intracranial volume (12q14.3; N = 15,782; P = 1.12 x 10(-12)). We also identified a suggestive association with total brain volume at rs10494373 within DDR2 (1q23.3; N = 6,500; P = 5.81 x 10(-7)). :: Notes: Stein, Jason L :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22504417 :: Author Address: Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, California, USA.

After searching 546,314 genomic markers, 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were associated with bilateral temporal lobe volume (P < 5 × 10− 7). One SNP, rs10845840, is located in the GRIN2B gene which encodes the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor NR2B subunit. This protein – involved in learning and memory, and excitotoxic cell death – has age-dependent prevalence in the synapse and is already a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease. Risk alleles for lower temporal lobe volume at this SNP were significantly over-represented in AD and MCI subjects vs. controls (odds ratio = 1.273; P = 0.039) and were associated with mini-mental state exam scores (MMSE; t = − 2.114; P = 0.035) demonstrating a negative effect on global cognitive function. Voxelwise maps of genetic association of this SNP with regional brain volumes, revealed intense temporal lobe effects (FDR correction at q = 0.05; critical P = 0.0257).

Recent advances in neuroimaging and genetics have allowed collection of both highly detailed structural brain scans and genome-wide genotype information. This wealth of information presents a new opportunity to find the genes influencing brain structure. Here we explore the relation between 448,293 single nucleotide polymorphisms in each of 31,622 voxels of the entire brain across 740 elderly subjects (mean age+/-s.d.: 75.52+/-6.82 years; 438 male) including subjects with Alzheimer's disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, and healthy elderly controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We used tensor-based morphometry to measure individual differences in brain structure at the voxel level relative to a study-specific template based on healthy elderly subjects. We then conducted a genome-wide association at each voxel to identify genetic variants of interest. By studying only the most associated variant at each voxel, we developed a novel method to address the multiple comparisons problem and computational burden associated with the unprecedented amount of data. No variant survived the strict significance criterion, but several genes worthy of further exploration were identified, including CSMD2 and CADPS2. These genes have high relevance to brain structure. This is the first voxelwise genome wide association study to our knowledge, and offers a novel method to discover genetic influences on brain structure. :: Notes: Stein, Jason L :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20171287 :: Author Address: Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Department of Neurology, University of California, Los Angeles School of Medicine, Neuroscience Research Building 225E, 635 Charles Young Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1769, USA.

To identify specific genes associated with variations in caudate volume, structural magnetic resonance imaging and genome-wide genotypes were acquired from two large cohorts, the Alzheimer's Disease NeuroImaging Initiative (ADNI; N=734) and the Brisbane Adolescent/Young Adult Longitudinal Twin Study (BLTS; N=464). In a preliminary analysis of heritability, around 90% of the variation in caudate volume was due to genetic factors. We then conducted genome-wide association to find common variants that contribute to this relatively high heritability. Replicated genetic association was found for the right caudate volume at single-nucleotide polymorphism rs163030 in the ADNI discovery sample (P=2.36 x 10(-)(6)) and in the BLTS replication sample (P=0.012). This genetic variation accounted for 2.79 and 1.61% of the trait variance, respectively. The peak of association was found in and around two genes, WDR41 and PDE8B, involved in dopamine signaling and development. In addition, a previously identified mutation in PDE8B causes a rare autosomal-dominant type of striatal degeneration. Searching across both samples offers a rigorous way to screen for genes consistently influencing brain structure at different stages of life. Variants identified here may be relevant to common disorders affecting the caudate. :: Notes: Stein, J L :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21502949 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

The study design commonly used is the long-term randomized, placebo-controlled trial (RPCT), meaning that many patients will receive placebo for 18 months or longer. It is ethically problematic to expose presymptomatic AD patients, who by definition are at risk of developing dementia, to prolonged placebo treatment. As an alternative to long-term RPCTs we propose a novel clinical study design, termed the placebo group simulation approach (PGSA), using mathematical models to forecast outcomes of presymptomatic AD patients from their own baseline data. Forecasted outcomes are compared with outcomes observed on candidate drugs, thus replacing a concomitant placebo group. METHODS: First models were constructed using mild cognitive impairment (MCI) data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. One outcome is the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale - cognitive subscale (ADAScog) score after 24 months, predicted in a linear regression model; the other is the trajectory over 36 months of a composite neuropsychological test score (Neuro-Psychological Battery (NP-Batt)), using a mixed model. Demographics and clinical, biological and neuropsychological baseline values were tested as potential predictors in both models. RESULTS: ADAScog scores after 24 months are predicted from gender, obesity, Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) and baseline scores of Mini-Mental State Examination, ADAScog and NP-Batt with an R2 of 0.63 and a residual standard deviation of 0.67, allowing reasonably precise estimates of sample means. The model of the NP-Batt trajectory has random intercepts and slopes and fixed effects for body mass index, time, apolipoprotein E4, age, FAQ, baseline scores of ADAScog and NP-Batt, and four interaction terms. Estimates of the residual standard deviation range from 0.3 to 0.5 on a standard normal scale. If novel drug candidates are expected to diminish the negative slope of scores with time, a change of 0.04 per year could be detected in samples of 400 with a power of about 80%. CONCLUSIONS: First PGSA models derived from ADNI MCI data allow prediction of cognitive endpoints and trajectories that correspond well with real observed values. Corroboration of these models with data from other observational studies is ongoing. It is suggested that the PGSA may complement RPCT designs in forthcoming long-term drug studies with presymptomatic AD individuals. :: Notes: Spiegel, Rene :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21418632 :: Author Address: University Hospital Department of Geriatrics, Memory Clinic, Schanzenstrasse 55, CH 4031 Basel, Switzerland. rene.spiegel@unibas.ch.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was approved by the institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. All subjects or their legal representatives gave informed consent for participation. Ninety-five subjects (63 male; average age, 77.1 years; age range, 58-91 years; 51 APOE4 carriers; 44 noncarriers) with either documented MCI to AD conversion or stable amnestic MCI underwent three yearly magnetic resonance imaging examinations. Voxel-based morphometry for image postprocessing and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale for cognitive assessment were used. RESULTS: In APOE4 carriers, GM volume loss affected the hippocampi, temporal and parietal lobes, right caudate nucleus, and insulae in patients with MCI to AD conversion and the insular and temporal lobes in patients in whom MCI was stable. In subjects who were not APOE4 carriers, there was no significant GM volume change. There were no differences in CDR scores between APOE4 carriers and noncarriers. CONCLUSION: APOE4 carriers with cognitive decline undergo faster GM atrophy than do noncarriers. The involvement of APOE4 in the progression of hippocampal atrophy, neocortical atrophy, or both has potential important implications for diagnosis and therapeutic approaches in patients with AD and should be considered in clinical trials. The present results and the results of prior studies indicate that the rate of hippocampal and neocortical atrophy is greater in association with APOE4 in nondemented elderly subjects, subjects with MCI, and those with AD. :: Notes: Spampinato, Maria Vittoria :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21163916 :: Author Address: Department of Radiology, Medical University of South Carolina, 96 Jonathan Lucas St, MSC 323, Charleston, SC, USA. spampin@musc.edu

Consequently, the search for a relatively inexpensive and harmless biomarker for AD continues. Despite intensive research worldwide, to date there is no definitive plasma or blood biomarker indicating high or low risk of conversion to AD. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging and beta-amyloid (Abeta) levels in three blood compartments (diluted in plasma, undiluted in plasma and cell-bound) were measured in 96 subjects (33 with mild cognitive impairment, 14 with AD and 49 healthy controls). Pearson correlations were completed between 113 regions of interest (ROIs) (45 subcortical and 68 cortical) and Abeta levels. Pearson correlation analyses adjusted for the covariates age, sex, apolipoprotein E (ApoE), education and creatinine levels showed neuroimaging ROIs were associated with Abeta levels. Two statistical methods were applied to study the major relationships identified: (1) Pearson correlation with phenotype added as a covariate and (2) a meta-analysis stratified by phenotype. Neuroimaging data and plasma Abeta measurements were taken from 630 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects to be compared with our results. RESULTS: The left hippocampus was the brain region most correlated with Abeta(1-40) bound to blood cell pellets (partial correlation (pcor) = -0.37, P = 0.0007) after adjustment for the covariates age, gender and education, ApoE and creatinine levels. The correlation remained almost the same (pcor = -0.35, P = 0.002) if phenotype is also added as a covariate. The association between both measurements was independent of cognitive status. The left hemisphere entorhinal cortex also correlated with Abeta(1-40) cell-bound fraction. AB128 and ADNI plasma Abeta measurements were not related to any brain morphometric measurement. CONCLUSIONS: Association of cell-bound Abeta(1-40) in blood with left hippocampal volume was much stronger than previously observed in Abeta plasma fractions. If confirmed, this observation will require careful interpretation and must be taken into account for blood amyloid-based biomarker development. :: Notes: Sotolongo-Grau, Oscar :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25484928 :: Author Address: Alzheimer Research Center and Memory Clinic, Fundacio ACE Memory Clinic, Institut Catala de Neurociencies Aplicades, Marques de Sentmenat, 57, Barcelona, 08029, Spain.

Objective: To evaluate the dynamics of age-related changes in brain structure and cognitive function in patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in healthy control (HC) older adults. Methods: High-resolution 3-Tesla MRI and clinical data were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative in 187 subjects (a cohort aged 55-91 years; AD=43, MCI=84, HC=60). At 24 months, 151 people had clinical and 128 had MRI follow-up. Brain structure was assessed using the Medial Temporal Atrophy Scale (MTAS) and the Brain Atrophy and Lesion Index (BALI). Cognition was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). Responsiveness was tested. Changes were analysed using a multistate dynamic model, adjusted for age, gender, ApoE4 genotype and vascular risk factors. Results: Over 2 years, decline in brain structure and cognition predominated, each showing detectable effect sizes (Cohen's d=0.33 for MTAS, 0.32 for BALI, 0.41 for MMSE, 0.38 for ADAS-cog; standard response mean=0.71, 0.69, 0.50 and 0.47, respectively). Structural improvement was observed (10.2% in BALI and 0.8% in MTAS), as was cognitive improvement (23.2% MMSE, 27.2% ADAS-cog). Most people (66.7%) whose BALI score improved also improved in either the MMSE or ADAS-cog. No patient with MCI whose MTAS or BALI improved converted to AD. Conclusions: Despite average decline in brain structure, improvement was observed and related to cognition and MCI-AD conversion. Ageing-related brain changes reflect a dynamic process. :: Notes: Cited By (since 1996):4 :: URL: http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84871208261&partnerID=40&md5=a0c71ca034df7575a1ef622e40d22080 :: Author Address: Biodiagnostics Atlantic, National Research Council Canada, Halifax, NS, Canada

OBJECTIVE: To apply a multiplex immunoassay panel to identify plasma biomarkers of AD using plasma samples from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: The Biomarkers Consortium Alzheimer's Disease Plasma Proteomics Project. PARTICIPANTS: Plasma samples at baseline and at 1 year were analyzed from 396 (345 at 1 year) patients with mild cognitive impairment, 112 (97 at 1 year) patients with AD, and 58 (54 at 1 year) healthy control subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Multivariate and univariate statistical analyses were used to examine differences across diagnostic groups and relative to the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. RESULTS: Increased levels of eotaxin 3, pancreatic polypeptide, and N-terminal protein B-type brain natriuretic peptide were observed in patients, confirming similar changes reported in cerebrospinal fluid samples of patients with AD and MCI. Increases in tenascin C levels and decreases in IgM and ApoE levels were also observed. All participants with Apo epsilon3/epsilon4 or epsilon4/epsilon4 alleles showed a distinct biochemical profile characterized by low C-reactive protein and ApoE levels and by high cortisol, interleukin 13, apolipoprotein B, and gamma interferon levels. The use of plasma biomarkers improved specificity in differentiating patients with AD from controls, and ApoE plasma levels were lowest in patients whose mild cognitive impairment had progressed to dementia. CONCLUSIONS: Plasma biomarker results confirm cerebrospinal fluid studies reporting increased levels of pancreatic polypeptide and N-terminal protein B-type brain natriuretic peptide in patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment. Incorporation of plasma biomarkers yielded high sensitivity with improved specificity, supporting their usefulness as a screening tool. The ApoE genotype was associated with a unique biochemical profile irrespective of diagnosis, highlighting the importance of genotype on blood protein profiles. :: Notes: Soares, Holly D :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22801723 :: Author Address: Bristol-Myers Squibb, Wallingford, CT 06492, USA.

Smaller reductions in similar regions have also been reported in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), a canonical precursor to AD. We previously demonstrated that volume loss in bilateral anteromedial temporal lobe is present at baseline in longitudinally followed normal subjects who later developed MCI or AD. In this study we compared grey matter volumes within this predefined anteromedial temporal region (AMTR) at baseline between: 1) normal subjects enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) who subsequently developed cognitive complaints as reflected in a CDR memory box score of 0.5; and 2) normal subjects who remained normal over a median of 48 months of follow-up (CDR sum of boxes 0). We found significantly decreased volume within AMTR in the ADNI memory complainers. To relate AMTR results to those from conventional anatomy, we demonstrate that volumes extracted with the ICBM amygdala region had the best correspondence with AMTR volumes. In contrast, regions that have demonstrated volume loss in frank MCI and AD in ADNI, e.g., the posterior cingulate, did not show volume loss. These findings provide independent confirmation that volume changes preceding MCI occur in AMTR, a region of overlap between amygdala and anterior hippocampus. :: Notes: Smith, Charles D :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22460332 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, Chandler Medical Center, University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536-0098, USA. csmith@mri.uky.edu

We propose a modeling strategy using supervised feature extraction to optimally combine high-dimensional imaging modalities with several other low-dimensional disease risk factors. The motivation is to discover new imaging biomarkers and use them in conjunction with other known biomarkers for prognosis of individuals at high risk of developing AD. Our framework also has the ability to assess the relative importance of imaging modalities for predicting AD conversion.

Tests based on the size of spatially extended clusters of contiguous suprathreshold voxels are also widely used due to their typically increased statistical power. In "imaging genetics", such tests are used to identify regions of the brain that are associated with genetic variation. However, concerns have been raised about the adequate control of rejection rates in studies of this type. A previous study tested the effect of a set of 'null' SNPs on brain structure and function, and found that false positive rates were well-controlled. However, no similar analysis of false positive rates in an imaging genetic study using cluster size inference has yet been undertaken. We measured false positive rates in an investigation of the effect of 700 pre-selected null SNPs on grey matter volume using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). As VBM data exhibit spatially-varying smoothness, we used both non-stationary and stationary cluster size tests in our analysis. Image and genotype data on 181 subjects with mild cognitive impairment were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). At a nominal significance level of 5%, false positive rates were found to be well-controlled (3.9-5.6%), using a relatively high cluster-forming threshold, alpha(c)=0.001, on images smoothed with a 12 mm Gaussian kernel. Tests were however anticonservative at lower cluster-forming thresholds (alpha(c)=0.01, 0.05), and for images smoothed using a 6mm Gaussian kernel. Here false positive rates ranged from 9.8 to 67.6%. In a further analysis, false positive rates using simulated data were observed to be well-controlled across a wide range of conditions. While motivated by imaging genetics, our findings apply to any VBM study, and suggest that parametric cluster size inference should only be used with high cluster-forming thresholds and smoothness. We would advocate the use of nonparametric methods in other cases. :: Notes: Silver, Matt :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20849959 :: Author Address: Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London, London, UK.

Most existing pathways-based methods rely on marginal SNP statistics and do not fully exploit the dependence patterns among SNPs within pathways.We use a sparse regression model, with SNPs grouped into pathways, to identify causal pathways associated with a quantitative trait. Notable features of our "pathways group lasso with adaptive weights" (P-GLAW) algorithm include the incorporation of all pathways in a single regression model, an adaptive pathway weighting procedure that accounts for factors biasing pathway selection, and the use of a bootstrap sampling procedure for the ranking of important pathways. P-GLAW takes account of the presence of overlapping pathways and uses a novel combination of techniques to optimise model estimation, making it fast to run, even on whole genome datasets.In a comparison study with an alternative pathways method based on univariate SNP statistics, our method demonstrates high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of important pathways, showing the greatest relative gains in performance where marginal SNP effect sizes are small. :: Notes: Silver, Matt :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22499682 :: Author Address: Imperial College London, UK.

Our method, known as pathways sparse reduced-rank regression (PsRRR), uses group lasso penalised regression to jointly model the effects of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), grouped into functional pathways using prior knowledge of gene-gene interactions. Pathways are ranked in order of importance using a resampling strategy that exploits finite sample variability. Our application study uses whole genome scans and MR images from 99 probable AD patients and 164 healthy elderly controls in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. 66,182 SNPs are mapped to 185 gene pathways from the KEGG pathway database. Voxel-wise imaging signatures characteristic of AD are obtained by analysing 3D patterns of structural change at 6, 12 and 24 months relative to baseline. High-ranking, AD endophenotype-associated pathways in our study include those describing insulin signalling, vascular smooth muscle contraction and focal adhesion. All of these have been previously implicated in AD biology. In a secondary analysis, we investigate SNPs and genes that may be driving pathway selection. High ranking genes include a number previously linked in gene expression studies to beta-amyloid plaque formation in the AD brain (PIK3R3,PIK3CG,PRKCAandPRKCB), and to AD related changes in hippocampal gene expression (ADCY2, ACTN1, ACACA, and GNAI1). Other high ranking previously validated AD endophenotype-related genes include CR1, TOMM40 and APOE. :: Notes: Silver, Matt :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22982105 :: Author Address: Statistics Section, Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London, UK.

Hippocampal volume loss is an early event in AD that triggers cognitive decline. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Regression analyses of the effects of education on MRI-measured baseline HV in 675 subjects (201 normal, 329 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 146 subjects with mild AD), adjusting for age, gender, APOE varepsilon4 status and intracranial volume (ICV). Subjects were derived from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), a large US national biomarker study. RESULTS: The association between higher education and larger HV was significant in AD (P=0.014) but not in cognitively normal or MCI subjects. In AD, HV was about 8% larger in a person with 20 years of education relative to someone with 6 years of education. There was also a trend for the interaction between education and APOE varepsilon4 to be significant in AD (P=0.056). CONCLUSION: A potential protective association between higher education and lower hippocampal atrophy in patients with AD appears consistent with prior epidemiologic data linking higher education levels with lower rates of incident dementia. Longitudinal studies are warranted to confirm these findings. :: Notes: Shpanskaya, Katie S :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24485897 :: Author Address: Department of psychiatry, neurocognitive disorders program, DUMC-3018, Duke University Medical Center, 27708 Durham, NC, United States; Duke Institute for Brain Sciences, 27708 Durham, NC, United States.

The longitudinal relationships between cognitive decline and metabolic function as assessed using (18)F-FDG PET are needed to address both the cognitive and the biologic progression of disease state in individual subjects. We conducted an exploratory investigation to evaluate longitudinal changes in brain glucose metabolism of individual subjects and their relationship to the subject's changes of cognitive status. METHODS: We describe a method to determine correlations in (18)F-FDG spatial distribution over time. This parameter is termed the regional (18)F-FDG time correlation coefficient (rFTC). By using linear mixed-effects models, we determined the difference in the rFTC decline rate between controls and subjects at high risk of developing AD, such as individuals with MCI or the presence of apolipoprotein E (APOE)-epsilon4 allele. The association between each subject's rFTC and performance on cognitive tests (ADAS_cog, MMSE, and FAQ) was determined with 2 different correlation methods. All subject data were downloaded from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. RESULTS: The rFTC values of controls remained fairly constant over time (-0.003 annual change; 95% confidence interval, -0.010-0.004). In MCI patients, the rFTC declined faster than in controls by an additional annual change of -0.02 (95% confidence interval, -0.030 to -0.010). In MCI patients, the decline in rFTC was associated with cognitive decline (ADAS_cog, P = 0.011; FAQ, P = 0.0016; MMSE, P = 0.004). After a linear effect of time was accounted for, visit-to-visit changes in rFTC correlated with visit-to-visit changes in all 3 cognitive tests. CONCLUSION: Longitudinal changes in rFTC detect subtle metabolic changes in individuals associated with variations in their cognition. This analytic tool may be useful for a patient-based monitoring of cognitive decline. :: Notes: Shokouhi, Sepideh :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23864720 :: Author Address: Department of Radiology and Radiological Sciences, Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Science, Nashville, Tennessee, USA. sepideh.shokouhi@vanderbilt.edu

First, we conformally map a surface onto a planar rectangle space with holomorphic 1-forms. Second, we compute surface conformal representation by combining its local conformal factor and mean curvature and linearly scale the dynamic range of the conformal representation to form the feature image of the surface. Third, we align the feature image with a chosen template image via the fluid image registration algorithm, which has been extended into the curvilinear coordinates to adjust for the distortion introduced by surface parameterization. The inverse consistent image registration algorithm is also incorporated in the system to jointly estimate the forward and inverse transformations between the study and template images. This alignment induces a corresponding deformation on the surface. We tested the system on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) baseline dataset to study AD symptoms on hippocampus. In our system, by modeling a hippocampus as a 3D parametric surface, we nonlinearly registered each surface with a selected template surface. Then we used mTBM to analyze the morphometry difference between diagnostic groups. Experimental results show that the new system has better performance than two publicly available subcortical surface registration tools: FIRST and SPHARM. We also analyzed the genetic influence of the Apolipoprotein E[element of]4 allele (ApoE4), which is considered as the most prevalent risk factor for AD. Our work successfully detected statistically significant difference between ApoE4 carriers and non-carriers in both patients of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy control subjects. The results show evidence that the ApoE genotype may be associated with accelerated brain atrophy so that our work provides a new MRI analysis tool that may help presymptomatic AD research. :: Notes: Shi, Jie :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23587689 :: Author Address: School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, USA.

Hippocampal volumes are generally smaller in AD patients carrying the e4 allele compared to e4 noncarriers. Here we examined the effect of APOE e4 on hippocampal morphometry in a large imaging database-the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We automatically segmented and constructed hippocampal surfaces from the baseline MR images of 725 subjects with known APOE genotype information including 167 with AD, 354 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 204 normal controls. High-order correspondences between hippocampal surfaces were enforced across subjects with a novel inverse consistent surface fluid registration method. Multivariate statistics consisting of multivariate tensor-based morphometry (mTBM) and radial distance were computed for surface deformation analysis. Using Hotelling's T(2) test, we found significant morphological deformation in APOE e4 carriers relative to noncarriers in the entire cohort as well as in the nondemented (pooled MCI and control) subjects, affecting the left hippocampus more than the right, and this effect was more pronounced in e4 homozygotes than heterozygotes. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that showed e4 carriers exhibit accelerated hippocampal atrophy; we extend these findings to a novel measure of hippocampal morphometry.

Some decline rapidly whereas others decline slowly, and there are no known explanations for this variability. We describe the first genome-wide association study to examine rate of cognitive decline in a sample of AD patients with longitudinal measures of cognition. METHODS: The discovery sample was 303 AD cases recruited in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the replication sample was 323 AD cases from the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. In the discovery sample, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale responses were tested for association with genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data using linear regression. We tested the 65 most significant SNPs from the discovery sample for association in the replication sample. RESULTS: We identified SNPs in the spondin 1 gene (SPON1), the minor alleles of which were significantly associated with a slower rate of decline (rs11023139, P = 7.0 x 10(-11)) in the discovery sample. A SPON1 SNP 5.5 kb upstream was associated with decline in the replication sample (rs11606345, P = .002). CONCLUSION: SPON1 has not been previously associated with AD risk, but is plausibly related because the gene product binds to the amyloid precursor protein and inhibits its cleavage by beta-secretase. These data suggest that SPON1 may be associated with the differential rate of cognitive decline in AD. :: Notes: Sherva, Richard :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23535033 :: Author Address: Department of Medicine (Biomedical Genetics), Boston University School of Medicine, Boston, MA, USA.

Here, we provide a systematic review of genetic studies published between 2009 and 2012 where either ADNI APOE genotype or genome-wide association study (GWAS) data were used. We review and synthesize ADNI genetic associations with disease status or quantitative disease endophenotypes including structural and functional neuroimaging, fluid biomarker assays, and cognitive performance. We also discuss the diverse analytical strategies used in these studies, including univariate and multivariate analysis, meta-analysis, pathway analysis, and interaction and network analysis. Finally, we perform pathway and network enrichment analyses of these ADNI genetic associations to highlight key mechanisms that may drive disease onset and trajectory. Major ADNI findings included all the top 10 AD genes and several of these (e.g., APOE, BIN1, CLU, CR1, and PICALM) were corroborated by ADNI imaging, fluid and cognitive phenotypes. ADNI imaging genetics studies discovered novel findings (e.g., FRMD6) that were later replicated on different data sets. Several other genes (e.g., APOC1, FTO, GRIN2B, MAGI2, and TOMM40) were associated with multiple ADNI phenotypes, warranting further investigation on other data sets. The broad availability and wide scope of ADNI genetic and phenotypic data has advanced our understanding of the genetic basis of AD and has nominated novel targets for future studies employing next-generation sequencing and convergent multi-omics approaches, and for clinical drug and biomarker development. :: Notes: Shen, Li :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24092460 :: Author Address: Center for Neuroimaging and Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Center, Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Indiana University School of Medicine, 355 W 16th Street, Suite 4100, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA, shenli@iu.edu.

The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1.5 T MRI and genetic dataset was investigated using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and FreeSurfer parcellation followed by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). One hundred forty-two measures of grey matter (GM) density, volume, and cortical thickness were extracted from baseline scans. GWAS, using PLINK, were performed on each phenotype using quality-controlled genotype and scan data including 530,992 of 620,903 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 733 of 818 participants (175 AD, 354 amnestic mild cognitive impairment, MCI, and 204 healthy controls, HC). Hierarchical clustering and heat maps were used to analyze the GWAS results and associations are reported at two significance thresholds (p<10(-7) and p<10(-6)). As expected, SNPs in the APOE and TOMM40 genes were confirmed as markers strongly associated with multiple brain regions. Other top SNPs were proximal to the EPHA4, TP63 and NXPH1 genes. Detailed image analyses of rs6463843 (flanking NXPH1) revealed reduced global and regional GM density across diagnostic groups in TT relative to GG homozygotes. Interaction analysis indicated that AD patients homozygous for the T allele showed differential vulnerability to right hippocampal GM density loss. NXPH1 codes for a protein implicated in promotion of adhesion between dendrites and axons, a key factor in synaptic integrity, the loss of which is a hallmark of AD. A genome-wide, whole brain search strategy has the potential to reveal novel candidate genes and loci warranting further investigation and replication. :: Notes: Shen, Li :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20100581 :: Author Address: Center for Neuroimaging, Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Indiana University School of Medicine, 950 West Walnut Street R2 E124, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. shenli@iupui.edu

METHODS: Amyloid-beta 1 to 42 peptide (A beta(1-42)), total tau (t-tau), and tau phosphorylated at the threonine 181 were measured in (1) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples obtained during baseline evaluation of 100 mild AD, 196 mild cognitive impairment, and 114 elderly cognitively normal (NC) subjects in ADNI; and (2) independent 56 autopsy-confirmed AD cases and 52 age-matched elderly NCs using a multiplex immunoassay. Detection of an AD CSF profile for t-tau and A beta(1-42) in ADNI subjects was achieved using receiver operating characteristic cut points and logistic regression models derived from the autopsy-confirmed CSF data. RESULTS: CSF A beta(1-42) was the most sensitive biomarker for AD in the autopsy cohort of CSF samples: receiver operating characteristic area under the curve of 0.913 and sensitivity for AD detection of 96.4%. In the ADNI cohort, a logistic regression model for A beta(1-42), t-tau, and APO epsilon 4 allele count provided the best assessment delineation of mild AD. An AD-like baseline CSF profile for t-tau/A beta(1-42) was detected in 33 of 37 ADNI mild cognitive impairment subjects who converted to probable AD during the first year of the study. INTERPRETATION: The CSF biomarker signature of AD defined by A beta(1-42) and t-tau in the autopsy-confirmed AD cohort and confirmed in the cohort followed in ADNI for 12 months detects mild AD in a large, multisite, prospective clinical investigation, and this signature appears to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment to AD. :: Notes: Shaw, Leslie M :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19296504 :: Author Address: Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Institute on Aging, Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. shawlmj@mail.med.upenn.edu

In addition, extreme homogeneity of ethnic origins of a population can make it difficult to interpret how genetic associations in that population may translate into other populations. Here we have evaluated the genetic substructure of samples from the Cache County study relative to the HapMap Reference populations and data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). RESULTS: Our findings show that the Cache County study is similar in ethnic diversity to the self-reported "Whites" in the ADNI sample and less homogenous than the HapMap CEU population. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the Cache County study is genetically representative of the general European American population in the USA and is an appropriate population for conducting broadly applicable genetic studies. :: Notes: Sharp, Aaron R :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25078123 ::

Materials and All protocols were approved by the institutional review Methods: board at each site, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The study was HIPAA compliant. Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) baseline magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and fuorine 18 fuorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) studies for 97 subjects with MCI were used. MR imaging-derived gray matter probability maps and FDG PET images were analyzed by using independent component analysis, an unbiased data-driven method to extract independent sources of information from whole-brain data. The loading parameters for all MR imaging and FDG components, along with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins, were entered into logistic regression models (dependent variable: conversion to AD within 4 years). Eight models were considered, including all combinations of MR imaging, PET, and CSF markers with the covariates (age, education, apolipoprotein E genotype, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale score). Results: Combining MR imaging, FDG PET, and CSF data with routine clinical tests significantly increased the accuracy of predicting conversion to AD compared with clinical testing alone. The misclassification rate decreased from 41.3% to 28.4% (P <.00001). FDG PET contributed more information to routine tests (P <.00001) than CSF (P =.32) or MR imaging (P =.08). Conclusion: Imaging and CSF biomarkers can improve prediction of conversion from MCI to AD compared with baseline clinical testing.

The objectives of this study were: (i) to test if constant and accelerated hippocampal loss can be detected in Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment and normal ageing over short periods, e.g. 6-12 months, with MRI in the large multicentre setting of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); (ii) to determine the extent to which the polymorphism of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) gene modulates hippocampal change; and (iii) to determine if rates of hippocampal loss correlate with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease, such as the beta-amyloid (Abeta(1-42)) and tau proteins (tau). The MRI multicentre study included 112 cognitive normal elderly individuals, 226 mild cognitive impairment and 96 Alzheimer's disease patients who all had at least three successive MRI scans, involving 47 different imaging centres. The mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease groups showed hippocampal volume loss over 6 months and accelerated loss over 1 year. Moreover, increased rates of hippocampal loss were associated with presence of the ApoE allele epsilon4 gene in Alzheimer's disease and lower CSF Abeta(1-42) in mild cognitive impairment, irrespective of ApoE genotype, whereas relations with tau were only trends. The power to measure hippocampal change was improved by exploiting correlations statistically between successive MRI observations. The demonstration of considerable hippocampal loss in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease patients over only 6 months and accelerated loss over 12 months illustrates the power of MRI to track morphological brain changes over time in a large multisite setting. Furthermore, the relations between faster hippocampal loss in the presence of ApoE allele epsilon4 and decreased CSF Abeta(1-42) supports the concept that increased hippocampal loss is an indicator of Alzheimer's disease pathology and a potential marker for the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in Alzheimer's disease. :: Notes: Schuff, N :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19251758 :: Author Address: Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, San Francisco, CA, USA. norbert.schuff@ucsf.edu

Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE epsilon4) gene dose is associated with three levels of risk for late-onset AD. We explored the association between gene dose and HCI in cognitively normal epsilon4 homozygotes, heterozygotes, and non-carriers. METHODS: An algorithm was used to characterize and compare AD-related HCIs in cognitively normal individuals, including 36 epsilon4 homozygotes, 46 heterozygotes, and 78 non-carriers. RESULTS: These three groups differed significantly in their HCIs (ANOVA, p = 0.004), and there was a significant association between HCIs and gene dose (linear trend, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The HCI is associated with three levels of genetic risk for late-onset AD. This supports the possibility of using a single FDG PET measurement to help in the preclinical detection and tracking of AD. :: Notes: Schraml, Frank :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23840615 :: Author Address: Departments of Radiology and Psychiatry, Saint Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center/The Barrow Neurologic Institute, Phoenix, Arizona, United States of America ; Department of Radiology, Creighton University School of Medicine, Omaha, Nebraska, United States of America.

The aim of this study was to assess whether characterizing case/control status on the basis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) profile would increase power to replicate known genetic associations for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Independent of clinical diagnosis, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects with 2 CSF biomarkers for AD (Abeta1-42 < 192 pg/mL and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (p-tau) > 23 pg/mL, "CSF-positive") were compared with those without CSF evidence for AD (Abeta1-42 > 192 pg/mL and 181-phosphorylated tau < 23 pg/mL, "CSF-negative"). Minor allele frequency (MAF) and odds ratios (ORs) between these 2 groups were calculated for 7 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of interest. Two hundred thirty-two individuals were CSF-positive and 94 CSF-negative. There were no differences in age (74.7 +/- 7.2 vs. 75.0 +/- 6.5 years, p = 0.7), but significant differences in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) (25.9 +/- 2.6 vs. 28.2 +/- 1.7, p < 0.001) between the CSF-positive and CSF-negative groups. Significant differences in MAF (p < 0.05, uncorrected) were seen for CR1 (rs1408077; OR, 1.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01-2.49), PICALM (rs541458; OR, 0.68, 95% CI, 0.47-0.98), TOMM40 (rs2075650; OR, 4.30; 95% CI, 2.61-7.06); and possession of 1 or more APOE epsilon4 alleles (OR, 9.84; 95% CI, 5.48-17.67). These results suggest that using biomarkers of AD pathology to define case and control status may increase power in genetic association studies. :: Notes: Schott, Jonathan M :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21459483 :: Author Address: Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, UK. jschott@dementia.ion.ucl.ac.uk

METHODS: Control subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with CSF and serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were dichotomized on CSF Abeta1-42 (normal control [NC]-high > 192 pg/ml; NC-low </= 192 pg/ml). Baseline and 1-year MRIs were registered, and brain, hippocampal, and ventricular volumes and annualized volume changes were calculated. Baseline characteristics, CSF profiles, neuropsychology, brain volumes and atrophy rates, and APOE, PICALM, CLU, and TOMM40 genotypes were compared. Sample sizes to power presymptomatic clinical trials based on rate of atrophy were calculated. RESULTS: Forty of 105 (38%) were classified as NC-low, and 65 (62%) as NC-high. There were no differences in age (76.3 +/- 5.1 vs 74.9 +/- 5.1 years), gender, brain volumes, and all but 1 cognitive score (Trails B; p = 0.015). The NC-low group had higher tau (p = 0.005) and p-tau (p < 0.001), and was more likely to be APOE4 positive (48% vs 11%, p < 0.001). The NC-low group had significantly higher whole brain loss (9.3 vs 4.4 ml/yr, p < 0.001), ventricular expansion (2.04 vs 0.95 ml/yr, p = 0.002), and hippocampal atrophy rate (0.07 vs 0.03 ml/yr, p = 0.029). Baseline Abeta1-42 level was strongly correlated with rate of brain atrophy only in the NC-low group (p < 0.001). Using 141 (95% confidence interval, 86-287) patients per arm provides 80% power in a 1-year treatment trial to show 25% slowing of brain atrophy in the NC-low group. INTERPRETATION: A significant percentage of healthy older adults have CSF profiles consistent with AD and increased rates of brain atrophy, suggesting that they may be in the earliest stages of neurodegeneration. Brain atrophy may be a feasible outcome measure for AD prevention studies. :: Notes: Schott, Jonathan M :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21181717 :: Author Address: Dementia Research Centre, University College London, Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom. jschott@dementia.ion.ucl.ac.uk

Genome-wide array data have been publicly released and updated, and several neuroimaging GWAS have recently been reported examining baseline magnetic resonance imaging measures as quantitative phenotypes. Other preliminary investigations include copy number variation in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease and GWAS of baseline cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and longitudinal changes on magnetic resonance imaging.

The model aims to describe the longitudinal progression of ADAS-cog scores from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative trial that had data from 198 MCI subjects with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) information who were followed for 3 years. METHOD: Various covariates were tested on disease progression parameters and these variables fell into six categories: imaging volumetrics, biochemical, genetic, demographic, cognitive tests and CSF biomarkers. RESULTS: CSF biomarkers were associated with both baseline disease score and disease progression rate in subjects with MCI. Baseline disease score was also correlated with atrophy measured using hippocampal volume. Progression rate was also predicted by executive functioning as measured by the Trail B-test. CONCLUSION: CSF biomarkers have the ability to discriminate MCI subjects into sub-populations that exhibit markedly different rates of disease progression on the ADAS-cog scale. These biomarkers can therefore be utilized for designing clinical trials enriched with subjects that carry the underlying disease pathology. :: Notes: Samtani, Mahesh N :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22534009 :: Author Address: Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, Clinical Pharmacology Department, Raritan, New Jersey 08869, USA. msamtani@its.jnj.com

The model describes the rate of progression and baseline disease severity as a function of influential covariates. The covariates that were tested fell into 4 categories: (1) imaging volumetric measures, (2) serum biomarkers, (3) demographic and genetic factors, and (4) baseline cognitive tests. Covariates found to affect baseline disease status were years since disease onset, hippocampal volume, and ventricular volume. Disease progression rate in the model was influenced by age, total cholesterol, APOE epsilon4 genotype, Trail Making Test (part B) score, and current levels of impairment as measured by ADAS-cog. Rate of progression was slower for mild and severe Alzheimer patients compared with moderate Alzheimer patients who exhibited faster rates of deterioration. In conclusion, this model describes disease progression in Alzheimer patients using novel covariates that are important for understanding the worsening of ADAS-cog scores over time and may be useful in the future for optimizing study designs through clinical trial simulations. :: Notes: Samtani, Mahesh N :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21659625 :: Author Address: Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research & Development, Raritan, NJ, USA. msamtani@its.jnj.com

In addition to Apoliprotein E (APOE) epsilon4, the major genetic risk factor, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a growing list of sequence variations associated with the disease. Building on a prior large-scale AD GWAS, we used a recently developed analytic method to compute a polygenic score that involves up to 26 independent common sequence variants and is associated with AD dementia, above and beyond APOE. We then examined the associations between the polygenic score and the magnetic resonance imaging-derived thickness measurements across AD-vulnerable cortex in clinically normal (CN) human subjects (N = 104). AD-specific cortical thickness was correlated with the polygenic risk score, even after controlling for APOE genotype and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of beta-amyloid (Abeta(1-42)). Furthermore, the association remained significant in CN subjects with levels of CSF Abeta(1-)(42) in the normal range and in APOE epsilon3 homozygotes. The observation that genetic risk variants are associated with thickness across AD-vulnerable regions of interest in CN older individuals, suggests that the combination of polygenic risk profile, neuroimaging, and CSF biomarkers may hold synergistic potential to aid in the prediction of future cognitive decline. :: Notes: Sabuncu, Mert R :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22169231 :: Author Address: Athinoula A.

In this study, multiple heterogeneous predictors of AD were combined using a supervised learning method called Disease State Index (DSI). The behavior of DSI values over time was examined to study disease progression quantitatively in a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cohort. The DSI method was applied to longitudinal data from 140 MCI cases that progressed to AD and 149 MCI cases that did not progress to AD during the follow-up. The data included neuropsychological tests, brain volumes from magnetic resonance imaging, cerebrospinal fluid samples, and apolipoprotein E from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Linear regression of the longitudinal DSI values (including the DSI value at the point of MCI to AD conversion) was performed for each subject having at least three DSI values available (147 non-converters, 126 converters). Converters had five times higher slopes and almost three times higher intercepts than non-converters. Two subgroups were found in the group of non-converters: one group with stable DSI values over time and another group with clearly increasing DSI values suggesting possible progression to AD in the future. The regression parameters differentiated between the converters and the non-converters with classification accuracy of 76.9% for the slopes and 74.6% for the intercepts. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that quantifying longitudinal patient data using the DSI method provides valid information for follow-up of disease progression and support for decision making.

In humans, several polymorphisms in DRD2, the gene encoding these receptors, increase our genetic risk for developing addictive disorders. Here, we examined one of the most frequently studied candidate variant for addiction in DRD2 for association with brain structure. We tested whether this variant showed associations with regional brain volumes across two independent elderly cohorts, totaling 1,032 subjects. We first examined a large sample of 738 elderly participants with neuroimaging and genetic data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI1). We hypothesized that this addiction-related polymorphism would be associated with structural brain differences in regions previously implicated in familial vulnerability for drug dependence. Then, we assessed the generalizability of our findings by testing this polymorphism in a non-overlapping replication sample of 294 elderly subjects from a continuation of the first ADNI project (ADNI2) to minimize the risk of reporting false positive results. In both cohorts, the minor allele-previously linked with increased risk for addiction-was associated with larger volumes in various brain regions implicated in reward processing. These findings suggest that neuroanatomical phenotypes associated with familial vulnerability for drug dependence may be partially mediated by DRD2 genotype. :: Notes: Roussotte, Florence F :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634060 :: Author Address: Imaging Genetics Center, Institute for Neuroimaging and Informatics Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095, USA.

These receptors play a key role in the reinforcing properties of drugs of abuse, and polymorphisms in OPRD1 (the gene encoding delta opioid receptors) are associated with drug addiction. Delta opioid receptors are also involved in protecting neurons against hypoxic and ischemic stress. Here, we first examined a large sample of 738 elderly participants with neuroimaging and genetic data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We hypothesized that common variants in OPRD1 would be associated with differences in brain structure, particularly in regions relevant to addictive and neurodegenerative disorders. One very common variant (rs678849) predicted differences in regional brain volumes. We replicated the association of this single-nucleotide polymorphism with regional tissue volumes in a large sample of young participants in the Queensland Twin Imaging study. Although the same allele was associated with reduced volumes in both cohorts, the brain regions affected differed between the two samples. In healthy elderly, exploratory analyses suggested that the genotype associated with reduced brain volumes in both cohorts may also predict cerebrospinal fluid levels of neurodegenerative biomarkers, but this requires confirmation. If opiate receptor genetic variants are related to individual differences in brain structure, genotyping of these variants may be helpful when designing clinical trials targeting delta opioid receptors to treat neurological disorders. :: Notes: Roussotte, Florence F :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23427138 :: Author Address: Imaging Genetics Center, Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, California; Department of Pediatrics, Developmental Cognitive Neuroimaging Laboratory (DCNL), University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California.

A recent genome-wide association study of LOAD found the strongest evidence of association with CLU at rs1532278, in high linkage disequilibrium with rs11136000. Brain structure and function are related to the CLU risk alleles, not just in LOAD patients but also in healthy young adults. We tracked the volume of the lateral ventricles across baseline, 1-year, and 2-year follow-up scans in a large sample of elderly human participants (N = 736 at baseline), from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, to determine whether these CLU risk variants predicted longitudinal ventricular expansion. The rs11136000 major C allele-previously linked with reduced CLU expression and with increased risk for dementia-predicted faster expansion, independently of dementia status or ApoE genotype. Further analyses revealed that the CLU and ApoE risk variants had combined effects on both volumetric expansion and lateral ventricle surface morphology. The rs1532278 locus strongly resembles a regulatory element. Its association with ventricular expansion was slightly stronger than that of rs11136000 in our analyses, suggesting that it may be closer to a functional variant. Clusterin affects inflammation, immune responses, and amyloid clearance, which in turn may result in neurodegeneration. Pharmaceutical agents such as valproate, which counteract the effects of genetically determined reduced clusterin expression, may help to achieve neuroprotection and contribute to the prevention of dementia, especially in carriers of these CLU risk variants. :: Notes: Roussotte, Florence F :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24806679 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, and Department of Psychiatry, Semel Institute, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095, Imaging Genetics Center, and Departments of Neurology, and Psychiatry, Radiology, Engineering, Pediatrics, and Ophthalmology, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90033.

Expansion of the lateral ventricles occurs with normal aging, but dementia accelerates this process. Brain structure and function depend on ApoE genotype not just for Alzheimer's disease patients but also in healthy elderly individuals, and even in asymptomatic young individuals. Therefore, we hypothesized that the ApoE-epsilon4 allele is associated with altered patterns of longitudinal ventricular expansion, in dementia and normal aging. We tested this hypothesis in a large sample of elderly participants, using a linear discriminant analysis-based approach. Carrying more ApoE-epsilon4 alleles was associated with faster ventricular expansion bilaterally and with regional patterns of lateral ventricle morphology at 1- and 2-year follow up, after controlling for sex, age, and dementia status. ApoE genotyping is considered critical in clinical trials of Alzheimer's disease. These findings, combined with earlier investigations showing that ApoE is also directly implicated in other conditions, suggest that the selective enrollment of ApoE-epsilon4 carriers may empower clinical trials of other neurological disorders. :: Notes: Roussotte, Florence F :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24411483 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

In a recent case-control study of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a regulatory polymorphism in DAT1 showed a significant association with the clinical stages of dementia. METHODS: We tested whether this variant was associated with increased AD risk, and with measures of cognitive decline and longitudinal ventricular expansion, in a large sample of elderly participants with genetic, neurocognitive, and neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. RESULTS: The minor allele-previously linked with increased DAT expression in vitro-was more common in AD patients than in both individuals with mild cognitive impairment and healthy elderly controls. The same allele was also associated with poorer cognitive performance and faster ventricular expansion, independently of diagnosis. CONCLUSION: These results may be due to reduced dopaminergic transmission in carriers of the DAT1 mutation. :: Notes: Roussotte, Florence F :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25496873 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA; Imaging Genetics Center, Institute for Neuroimaging and Informatics, Department of Neurology, Keck/USC School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Here, we tested whether this variant - associated with lower alcohol consumption - showed associations with brain structure and longitudinal ventricular expansion over time, across two independent elderly cohorts, totaling 1,032 subjects. We first examined a large sample of 738 elderly participants with neuroimaging and genetic data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI1). Then, we assessed the generalizability of the findings by testing this polymorphism in a replication sample of 294 elderly subjects from a continuation of the first ADNI project (ADNI2) to minimize the risk of reporting false positive results. The minor allele - previously linked with lower alcohol intake - was associated with larger volumes in various cortical regions, notably the medial prefrontal cortex and cingulate gyrus in both cohorts. Intriguingly, the same allele also predicted faster ventricular expansion rates in the ADNI1 cohort at 1- and 2-year follow up. Despite a lack of alcohol consumption data in this study cohort, these findings, combined with earlier functional imaging investigations of the same gene, suggest the existence of reciprocal interactions between genes, brain, and drinking behavior. :: Notes: Roussotte, Florence F :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24409144 :: Author Address: Imaging Genetics Center, University of Southern California Los Angeles, CA, USA ; Departments of Neurology and Psychiatry, David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California Los Angeles Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Neurology :: ISSN: 1474-4465 (Electronic) ::  :: Accession Number: 25662776 :: Abstract: BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia is a highly heritable neurodegenerative disorder. In about a third of patients, the disease is caused by autosomal dominant genetic mutations usually in one of three genes: progranulin (GRN), microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT), or chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72). Findings from studies of other genetic dementias have shown neuroimaging and cognitive changes before symptoms onset, and we aimed to identify whether such changes could be shown in frontotemporal dementia. METHODS: We recruited participants to this multicentre study who either were known carriers of a pathogenic mutation in GRN, MAPT, or C9orf72, or were at risk of carrying a mutation because a first-degree relative was a known symptomatic carrier. We calculated time to expected onset as the difference between age at assessment and mean age at onset within the family. Participants underwent a standardised clinical assessment and neuropsychological battery. We did MRI and generated cortical and subcortical volumes using a parcellation of the volumetric T1-weighted scan. We used linear mixed-effects models to examine whether the association of neuropsychology and imaging measures with time to expected onset of symptoms differed between mutation carriers and non-carriers. FINDINGS: Between Jan 30, 2012, and Sept 15, 2013, we recruited participants from 11 research sites in the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Canada. We analysed data from 220 participants: 118 mutation carriers (40 symptomatic and 78 asymptomatic) and 102 non-carriers. For neuropsychology measures, we noted the earliest significant differences between mutation carriers and non-carriers 5 years before expected onset, when differences were significant for all measures except for tests of immediate recall and verbal fluency. We noted the largest Z score differences between carriers and non-carriers 5 years before expected onset in tests of naming (Boston Naming Test -0.7; SE 0.3) and executive function (Trail Making Test Part B, Digit Span backwards, and Digit Symbol Task, all -0.5, SE 0.2). For imaging measures, we noted differences earliest for the insula (at 10 years before expected symptom onset, mean volume as a percentage of total intracranial volume was 0.80% in mutation carriers and 0.84% in non-carriers; difference -0.04, SE 0.02) followed by the temporal lobe (at 10 years before expected symptom onset, mean volume as a percentage of total intracranial volume 8.1% in mutation carriers and 8.3% in non-carriers; difference -0.2, SE 0.1). INTERPRETATION: Structural imaging and cognitive changes can be identified 5-10 years before expected onset of symptoms in asymptomatic adults at risk of genetic frontotemporal dementia. These findings could help to define biomarkers that can stage presymptomatic disease and track disease progression, which will be important for future therapeutic trials.

We analyzed magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) atrophy rate from baseline to 1 year in 4 groups of participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): AD (n = 152), converters from MCI to probable AD (MCI-C, n = 60), stable MCI (MCI-S, n = 261), and healthy controls (HC, n = 200). Scans were analyzed using multiple methods, including voxel-based morphometry (VBM), regions of interest (ROIs), and automated parcellation, permitting comparison of annual percent change (APC) in neurodegeneration markers. Effect sizes and the sample required to detect 25% reduction in atrophy rates were calculated. The influence of APOE genotype on APC was also evaluated. AD patients and converters from MCI to probable AD demonstrated high atrophy APCs across regions compared with minimal change in healthy controls. Stable MCI subjects showed intermediate atrophy rates. APOE genotype was associated with APC in key regions. In sum, APC rates are influenced by APOE genotype, imminent MCI to AD conversion, and AD-related neurodegeneration. :: Notes: Risacher, Shannon L :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20620664 :: Author Address: Center for Neuroimaging, Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Indiana University, School of Medicine, 950 W Walnut St., Indianapolis, IN 46202, United States.

METHODS: Two-hundred and nine E-MCI and 123 HC participants from the ADNI-2 cohort were included. We evaluated the impact of diagnostic status (E-MCI vs. HC) and APOE epsilon4 status (epsilon4 positive vs. epsilon4 negative) on cortical amyloid deposition (AV-45/Florbetapir SUVR PET scans), brain atrophy (structural MRI scans processed using voxel-based morphometry and Freesurfer version 5.1), CSF levels of Abeta, tau, and p-tau, and cognitive performance and complaints. RESULTS: E-MCI participants showed significantly impaired cognition, higher levels of cognitive complaints, greater levels of tau and p-tau, and subcortical and cortical atrophy relative to HC participants (p < 0.05). Cortical amyloid deposition and CSF levels of Abeta were significantly associated with APOE epsilon4 status but not E-MCI diagnosis, with epsilon4 positive participants showing more amyloid deposition and lower levels of CSF Abeta than epsilon4 negative participants. Other effects of APOE epsilon4 status on cognition and CSF tau levels were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: APOE epsilon4 status is associated with amyloid accumulation and lower CSF Abeta, as well as increased CSF tau levels in early prodromal stages of AD (E-MCI) and HC. Alternatively, neurodegeneration, cognitive impairment, and increased complaints are primarily associated with a diagnosis of E-MCI. These findings underscore the importance of considering APOE genotype when evaluating biomarkers in early stages of disease. :: Notes: Risacher, Shannon L :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23554593 :: Author Address: Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Center for Neuroimaging, Indiana University School of Medicine Indianapolis, IN, USA.

(2005) Am J Hum Genet 76:717-728]. There is also evidence suggesting that MCPH genes have evolved rapidly in primates and humans and have been subjected to selection in recent human evolution [Vallender EJ, et al. (2008) Trends Neurosci 31:637-644]. Here, we show that common variants of MCPH genes account for some of the common variation in brain structure in humans, independently of disease status. We investigated the correlations of SNPs from four MCPH genes with brain morphometry phenotypes obtained with MRI. We found significant, sex-specific associations between common, nonexonic, SNPs of the genes CDK5RAP2, MCPH1, and ASPM, with brain volume or cortical surface area in an ethnically homogenous Norwegian discovery sample (n = 287), including patients with mental illness. The most strongly associated SNP findings were replicated in an independent North American sample (n = 656), which included patients with dementia. These results are consistent with the view that common variation in brain structure is associated with genetic variants located in nonexonic, presumably regulatory, regions. :: Notes: Rimol, Lars M :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20080800 :: Author Address: Division of Psychiatry, Oslo University Hospital-Ulleval, 0407 Oslo, Norway.

We used an endophenotype-based approach to further characterize mitochondrial genetic variation and its relationship to risk markers for Alzheimer's disease. We analyzed longitudinal data from non-demented, mild cognitive impairment, and late-onset Alzheimer's disease participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with genetic, brain imaging, and behavioral data. We assessed the relationship of structural MRI and cognitive biomarkers with mitochondrial genome variation using TreeScanning, a haplotype-based approach that concentrates statistical power by analyzing evolutionarily meaningful groups (or clades) of haplotypes together for association with a phenotype. Four clades were associated with three different endophenotypes: whole brain volume, percent change in temporal pole thickness, and left hippocampal atrophy over two years. This is the first study of its kind to identify mitochondrial variation associated with brain imaging endophenotypes of Alzheimer's disease. Our results provide additional evidence that the mitochondrial genome plays a role in risk for Alzheimer's disease. :: Notes: Ridge, Perry G :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24040196 :: Author Address: Department of Biology, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, United States of America ; ARUP Institute for Clinical and Experimental Pathology, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States of America.

METHODS: We used 1,877 Caucasian cases and controls from the NIA-LOAD study and 1,093 Caribbean Hispanics to further explore the association of FTO with AD. Using logistic regression, we assessed 42 SNPs in introns 1 and 2, the region previously reported to be associated with AD endophenotypes, which had been derived by genome-wide screenings. In addition, we performed gene expression analyses of neuropathologically confirmed AD cases and controls of two independent datasets (19 AD cases, 10 controls; 176 AD cases, 188 controls) using within- and between-group factors ANOVA of log(10) transformed rank invariant normalized expression data. RESULTS: In the NIALOAD study, one SNP was significantly associated with AD and three additional markers were close to significance (rs6499640, rs10852521, rs16945088, rs8044769, FDR p-value: 0.05<p<0.09). Two of the SNPs are in strong LD (D'>0.9) with the previously reported SNPs. In the Caribbean Hispanic dataset, we identified three SNPs (rs17219084, rs11075996, rs11075997, FDR p-value: 0.009<p<0.01) that were associated with AD. These results were confirmed by haplotype analyses and in a metaanalysis in which we included the ADNI dataset. FTO had a significantly lower expresssion in AD cases compared to controls in two independent datasets derived from human cortex and amygdala tissue, respectively (p = 2.18 x 10-5 and p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the notion that genetic variation in Introns 1 and 2 of the FTO gene may contribute to AD risk. :: Notes: Reitz, Christiane :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23251365 :: Author Address: The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, College of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, New York, New York, United States of America.

Molecular imaging can provide an early noninvasive phenotype, but small samples have prohibited genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of cortical Abeta load until now. We employed florbetapir ((18)F) positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to assess brain Abeta levels in vivo for 555 participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). More than six million common genetic variants were tested for association to quantitative global cortical Abeta load controlling for age, gender and diagnosis. Independent genome-wide significant associations were identified on chromosome 19 within APOE (apolipoprotein E) (rs429358, P=5.5 x 10(-14)) and on chromosome 3 upstream of BCHE (butyrylcholinesterase) (rs509208, P=2.7 x 10(-8)) in a region previously associated with serum BCHE activity. Together, these loci explained 15% of the variance in cortical Abeta levels in this sample (APOE 10.7%, BCHE 4.3%). Suggestive associations were identified within ITGA6, near EFNA5, EDIL3, ITGA1, PIK3R1, NFIB and ARID1B, and between NUAK1 and C12orf75. These results confirm the association of APOE with Abeta deposition and represent the largest known effect of BCHE on an AD-related phenotype. BCHE has been found in senile plaques and this new association of genetic variation at the BCHE locus with Abeta burden in humans may have implications for potential disease-modifying effects of BCHE-modulating agents in the AD spectrum. :: Notes: Ramanan, V K :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23419831 :: Author Address: 1] Center for Neuroimaging, Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences and Indiana Alzheimer's Disease Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA [2] Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA [3] Medical Scientist Training Program, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.

The genetic architecture underlying these memory deficits likely involves the combined effects of multiple genetic variants operative within numerous biological pathways. In order to identify functional pathways associated with memory impairment, we performed a pathway enrichment analysis on genome-wide association data from 742 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) participants. A composite measure of memory was generated as the phenotype for this analysis by applying modern psychometric theory to item-level data from the ADNI neuropsychological test battery. Using the GSA-SNP software tool, we identified 27 canonical, expertly-curated pathways with enrichment (FDR-corrected p-value < 0.05) against this composite memory score. Processes classically understood to be involved in memory consolidation, such as neurotransmitter receptor-mediated calcium signaling and long-term potentiation, were highly represented among the enriched pathways. In addition, pathways related to cell adhesion, neuronal differentiation and guided outgrowth, and glucose- and inflammation-related signaling were also enriched. Among genes that were highly-represented in these enriched pathways, we found indications of coordinated relationships, including one large gene set that is subject to regulation by the SP1 transcription factor, and another set that displays co-localized expression in normal brain tissue along with known AD risk genes. These results 1) demonstrate that psychometrically-derived composite memory scores are an effective phenotype for genetic investigations of memory impairment and 2) highlight the promise of pathway analysis in elucidating key mechanistic targets for future studies and for therapeutic interventions. :: Notes: Ramanan, Vijay K :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22865056 :: Author Address: Center for Neuroimaging, Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.

Leptin enters the central nervous system at levels that depend on an individual's body fat. Obese people, on average, show greater brain atrophy in old age, so it is valuable to know whether brain atrophy relates to leptin levels, which can be targeted by interventions. We therefore determined how plasma leptin levels, and BMI, relate to brain structure, and whether leptin levels might account for BMI's effect on the brain. We measured regional brain volumes using tensor-based morphometry, in MRI scans of 517 elderly individuals with plasma leptin measured (mean: 13.3+/-0.6 ng/ml; mean age: 75.2+/-7.3 years; 321 men/196 women). We related plasma leptin levels to brain volumes at every location in the brain after adjusting for age, sex, and diagnosis and, later, also BMI. Plasma leptin levels were significantly higher (a) in women than men, and (b) in obese versus overweight, normal or underweight individuals. People with higher leptin levels showed deficits in frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital lobes, brainstem, and the cerebellum, irrespective of age, sex, or diagnosis. These associations persisted after controlling for BMI. Greater brain atrophy may occur in people with central leptin insufficiency, a marker of obesity. Therapeutic manipulation of leptin may be a promising direction for slowing brain decline. :: Notes: Rajagopalan, Priya :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23238164 :: Author Address: Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Department of Neurology, Imaging Genetics Center, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

As homocysteine promotes brain atrophy, we set out to discover whether people carrying the C677T MTHFR polymorphism which increases homocysteine, might also show systematic differences in brain structure. Using tensor-based morphometry, we tested this association in 359 elderly Caucasian subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (mean age: 75 +/- 7.1 years) scanned with brain MRI and genotyped as part of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We carried out a replication study in an independent, non-overlapping sample of 51 elderly Caucasian subjects with MCI (mean age: 76 +/- 5.5 years), scanned with brain MRI and genotyped for MTHFR, as part of the Cardiovascular Health Study. At each voxel in the brain, we tested to see where regional volume differences were associated with carrying one or more MTHFR 'T' alleles. In ADNI subjects, carriers of the MTHFR risk allele had detectable brain volume deficits, in the white matter, of up to 2-8% per risk T allele locally at baseline and showed accelerated brain atrophy of 0.5-1.5% per T allele at 1 year follow-up, after adjusting for age and sex. We replicated these brain volume deficits of up to 5-12% per MTHFR T allele in the independent cohort of CHS subjects. As expected, the associations weakened after controlling for homocysteine levels, which the risk gene affects. The MTHFR risk variant may thus promote brain atrophy by elevating homocysteine levels. This study aims to investigate the spatially detailed effects of this MTHFR polymorphism on brain structure in 3D, pointing to a causal pathway that may promote homocysteine-mediated brain atrophy in elderly people with MCI. :: Notes: Rajagopalan, Priya :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24179750 :: Author Address: Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Department of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Two common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in APOE, rs429358 and rs7412, determine the three epsilon alleles that are established genetic risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD), cerebral amyloid angiopathy, and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). These two SNPs are not present in most commercially available genome-wide genotyping arrays and cannot be inferred through imputation using HapMap reference panels. Therefore, these SNPs are often separately genotyped. Introduction of reference panels compiled from the 1000 Genomes project has made imputation of these variants possible. We compared the directly genotyped and imputed SNPs that define the APOE epsilon alleles to determine the accuracy of imputation for inference of unobserved epsilon alleles. We utilized genome-wide genotype data obtained from two cohorts of ICH and AD constituting subjects of European ancestry. Our data suggest that imputation is highly accurate, yields an acceptable proportion of missing data that is non-differentially distributed across case and control groups, and generates comparable results to genotyped data for hypothesis testing. Further, we explored the effect of imputation algorithm parameters and demonstrated that customization of these parameters yields an improved balance between accuracy and missing data for inferred genotypes. :: Notes: Radmanesh, Farid :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24448547 :: Author Address: 1] Center for Human Genetic Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA [2] Department of Neurology, J Philip Kistler Stroke Research Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA [3] Division of Neurocritical Care and Emergency Neurology, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA [4] Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA.

We have used a Mendelian randomization approach to dissect the causal nature of the association between circulating lipid levels and late onset AD (LOAD) and test the hypothesis that genetically raised lipid levels increase the risk of LOAD. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included 3,914 patients with LOAD, 1,675 older individuals without LOAD, and 4,989 individuals from the general population from six genome wide studies drawn from a white population (total n=10,578). We constructed weighted genotype risk scores (GRSs) for four blood lipid phenotypes (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-c], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-c], triglycerides, and total cholesterol) using well-established SNPs in 157 loci for blood lipids reported by Willer and colleagues (2013). Both full GRSs using all SNPs associated with each trait at p<5x10-8 and trait specific scores using SNPs associated exclusively with each trait at p<5 x 10-8 were developed. We used logistic regression to investigate whether the GRSs were associated with LOAD in each study and results were combined together by meta-analysis. We found no association between any of the full GRSs and LOAD (meta-analysis results: odds ratio [OR]=1.005, 95% CI 0.82-1.24, p = 0.962 per 1 unit increase in HDL-c; OR=0.901, 95% CI 0.65-1.25, p=0.530 per 1 unit increase in LDL-c; OR=1.104, 95% CI 0.89-1.37, p=0.362 per 1 unit increase in triglycerides; and OR=0.954, 95% CI 0.76-1.21, p=0.688 per 1 unit increase in total cholesterol). Results for the trait specific scores were similar; however, the trait specific scores explained much smaller phenotypic variance. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic predisposition to increased blood cholesterol and triglyceride lipid levels is not associated with elevated LOAD risk. The observed epidemiological associations between abnormal lipid levels and LOAD risk could therefore be attributed to the result of biological pleiotropy or could be secondary to LOAD. Limitations of this study include the small proportion of lipid variance explained by the GRS, biases in case-control ascertainment, and the limitations implicit to Mendelian randomization studies. Future studies should focus on larger LOAD datasets with longitudinal sampled peripheral lipid measures and other markers of lipid metabolism, which have been shown to be altered in LOAD.

The aim of this study was to examine the genetic comorbidity between the 2 disorders and to investigate whether genetic liability to T2DM, estimated by a genotype risk scores based on T2DM associated loci, is associated with increased risk of LOAD. This study was performed in 2 stages. In stage 1, we combined genotypes for the top 15 T2DM-associated polymorphisms drawn from approximately 3000 individuals (1349 cases and 1351 control subjects) with extracted and/or imputed data from 6 genome-wide studies (>10,000 individuals; 4507 cases, 2183 controls, 4989 population controls) to form a genotype risk score and examined if this was associated with increased LOAD risk in a combined meta-analysis. In stage 2, we investigated the association of LOAD with an expanded T2DM score made of 45 well-established variants drawn from the 6 genome-wide studies. Results were combined in a meta-analysis. Both stage 1 and stage 2 T2DM risk scores were not associated with LOAD risk (odds ratio = 0.988; 95% confidence interval, 0.972-1.004; p = 0.144 and odds ratio = 0.993; 95% confidence interval, 0.983-1.003; p = 0.149 per allele, respectively). Contrary to expectation, genotype risk scores based on established T2DM candidates were not associated with increased risk of LOAD. The observed epidemiological associations between T2DM and LOAD could therefore be a consequence of secondary disease processes, pleiotropic mechanisms, and/or common environmental risk factors. Future work should focus on well-characterized longitudinal cohorts with extensive phenotypic and genetic data relevant to both LOAD and T2DM. :: Notes: Proitsi, Petroula :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25150574 :: Author Address: King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London, UK; Department of Psychiatry, State Key Laboratory of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, and Centre for Genomic Sciences, Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong.

Annual Conference :: ISSN: 1557-170X (Print) ::  :: Accession Number: 25570489 :: Abstract: Although many genetic markers are identified as being associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), not much is known about their association with the structural changes that happen as the disease progresses. In this study, we investigate the genetic etiology of neurodegeneration in AD by associating genetic markers with atrophy profiles obtained using patient data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. The atrophy profiles were quantified using a linear least-squares regression model over the span of patient enrollment, and used as imaging features throughout the analysis. A subset of the imaging features were selected for genetic association based on their ability to discriminate between healthy individuals and AD patients in a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. Each imaging feature was associated with single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using a linear model that included age and cognitive impairment scores as covariates to correct for normal disease progression. After false discovery rate correction, we observed 53 significant associations between SNPs and our imaging features, including associations of ventricular enlargement with SNPs on estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and sortilin-related VPS10 domain containing receptor 1 (SORCS1), hippocampal atrophy with SNPs on ESR1, and cerebral atrophy with SNPs on transferrin (TF) and amyloid beta precursor protein (APP). This study provides important insights into genetic predictors of specific types of neurodegeneration that could potentially be used to improve the efficacy of treatment strategies for the disease and allow the development of personalized treatment plans based on each patient's unique genetic profile. :: Notes: Printy, Blake P :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25570489 ::

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We completed a genome-wide association study on 381 participants in the ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) study. Samples were genotyped using the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip. 516,645 unique Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were included in the analysis following quality control measures. The genotype data and raw genetic data are freely available for download (LONI, http://www.loni.ucla.edu/ADNI/Data/). Two analyses were completed: a standard case-control analysis, and a novel approach using hippocampal atrophy measured on MRI as an objectively defined, quantitative phenotype. A General Linear Model was applied to identify SNPs for which there was an interaction between the genotype and diagnosis on the quantitative trait. The case-control analysis identified APOE and a new risk gene, TOMM40 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40), at a genome-wide significance level of < or =10(-6) (10(-11) for a haplotype). TOMM40 risk alleles were approximately twice as frequent in AD subjects as controls. The quantitative trait analysis identified 21 genes or chromosomal areas with at least one SNP with a p-value < or =10(-6), which can be considered potential "new" candidate loci to explore in the etiology of sporadic AD. These candidates included EFNA5, CAND1, MAGI2, ARSB, and PRUNE2, genes involved in the regulation of protein degradation, apoptosis, neuronal loss and neurodevelopment. Thus, we identified common genetic variants associated with the increased risk of developing AD in the ADNI cohort, and present publicly available genome-wide data. Supportive evidence based on case-control studies and biological plausibility by gene annotation is provided. Currently no available sample with both imaging and genetic data is available for replication. CONCLUSIONS: Using hippocampal atrophy as a quantitative phenotype in a genome-wide scan, we have identified candidate risk genes for sporadic Alzheimer's disease that merit further investigation. :: Notes: Potkin, Steven G :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19668339 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA. sgpotkin@uci.edu

In these same samples, these SNPs were also associated with faster functional decline, or progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes scores (CDR-sb). We attempted to validate the latter association in an independent, population-based sample of incident AD cases from the Cache County Dementia Progression Study (DPS). METHODS: All 92 AD cases from the DPS with a global CDR-sb </=1 (mild) at initial clinical assessment who were later assessed on CDR-sb data on at least two other time points were genotyped at the two SNPs of interest (rs1868402 and rs3785883). We used linear mixed models to estimate associations between these SNPs and CDR-sb trajectory. All analyses were performed using Proc Mixed in SAS. RESULTS: Although we observed no association between rs3785883 or rs1868402 alone and change in CDR-sb (P > .10), there was a significant association between a combined genotype model and change in CDR-sb: carriers of the high-risk genotypes at both loci progressed >2.9 times faster than noncarriers (P = .015). When data from DPS were combined with previously published data from WU and ADNI, change in CDR-sb was 30% faster for each copy of the high-risk allele at rs3785883 (P = .0082) and carriers of both high-risk genotypes at both loci progressed 6 times faster (P < .0001) than all others combined. CONCLUSIONS: We replicate a previous report by Cruchaga et al that specific variations in rs3785883 and rs1868402 are associated with accelerated progression of AD. Further characterization of this association will provide a better understanding of how genetic factors influence the rate of progression of AD and could provide novel insights into preventative and therapeutic strategies. :: Notes: Peterson, David :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23727081 :: Author Address: Department of Biology, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA.

Methods The Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) is a population-based longitudinal study of nondemented subjects in Olmsted County, Minnesota. A sample of 154 MCI subjects from the MCSA was compared to a sample of 58 amnestic MCI subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) to assess the applicability of the criteria in both settings and to assess their outcomes. Results Fourteen percent of MCSA and 16% of ADNI-1 of subjects were biomarker negative. In addition, 14% of MCSA and 12% of ADNI-1 subjects had evidence for amyloid deposition only, whereas 43% of MCSA and 55% of ADNI-1 subjects had evidence for amyloid deposition plus neurodegeneration (magnetic resonance imaging atrophy, fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography hypometabolism, or both). However, a considerable number of subjects had biomarkers inconsistent with the proposed AD model; for example, 29% of MCSA subjects and 17% of ADNI-1 subjects had evidence for neurodegeneration without amyloid deposition. These subjects may not be on an AD pathway. Neurodegeneration appears to be a key factor in predicting progression relative to amyloid deposition alone. Interpretation The NIA-AA criteria apply to most MCI subjects in both the community and clinical trials settings; however, a sizeable proportion of subjects had conflicting biomarkers, which may be very important and need to be explored. © 2013 American Neurological Association. :: Notes: Cited By (since 1996):5 :: URL: http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84884139365&partnerID=40&md5=a6c84e419faf4a29d7bab153da7a7403 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, 200 First Street SW, Rochester, MN 55905, United States

The availability of diagnostic criteria for preclinical Alzheimer Disease adds momentum to research directed at this goal and even to prevention. The landscape of therapeutic research is thus poised to undergo a dramatic shift in the next 5-10 years, with clinical trials involving subjects at risk for Alzheimer Disease who have few or no symptoms. These trials will also likely rely heavily on genetics, biomarkers, and or risk factor stratification to identify individuals at risk for Alzheimer Disease.

Nonetheless, these loci do not explain the entire susceptibility of the disease, suggesting that other genetic contributions remain to be identified. Here, we performed a meta-analysis combining data of 4,569 individuals (2,540 cases and 2,029 healthy controls) derived from three publicly available GWAS in AD and replicated a broad genomic region (>248,000 bp) associated with the disease near the APOE/TOMM40 locus in chromosome 19. To detect minor effect size contributions that could help to explain the remaining genetic risk, we conducted network-based pathway analyses either by extracting gene-wise p-values (GW), defined as the single strongest association signal within a gene, or calculated a more stringent gene-based association p-value using the extended Simes (GATES) procedure. Comparison of these strategies revealed that ontological sub-networks (SNs) involved in glutamate signaling were significantly overrepresented in AD (p<2.7x10(-11), p<1.9x10(-11); GW and GATES, respectively). Notably, glutamate signaling SNs were also found to be significantly overrepresented (p<5.1x10(-8)) in the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, which was used as a targeted replication sample. Interestingly, components of the glutamate signaling SNs are coordinately expressed in disease-related tissues, which are tightly related to known pathological hallmarks of AD. Our findings suggest that genetic variation within glutamate signaling contributes to the remaining genetic risk of AD and support the notion that functional biological networks should be targeted in future therapies aimed to prevent or treat this devastating neurological disorder. :: Notes: Perez-Palma, Eduardo :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24755620 :: Author Address: Center for Biomedical Research and FONDAP Center for Genome Regulation, Faculty of Biological Sciences and Faculty of Medicine, Universidad Andres Bello, Santiago, Chile.

One of the critical elements for visual MTA assessment is the cut-off score that determines deviation from normality. METHODS: In this study, we assessed the sensitivity and specificity of different MTA cut-off scores to classify control subjects, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD patients from two large independent cohorts, AddNeuroMed and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Of note, we evaluated the effects of clinical, demographic and genetic variables on the classification performance according to the different cut-offs. RESULTS: A cut-off of >/=1.5 based on the mean MTA scores of both hemispheres showed higher sensitivity in classifying patients with AD (84.5%) and MCI subjects (75.8%) who converted to dementia compared to an age-dependent cut-off. The age-dependent cut-off showed higher specificity or ability to correctly identify control subjects (83.2%) and those with MCI who remained stable (65.5%). Increasing age, early-onset disease and absence of the ApoE epsilon4 allele had a stronger influence on classifications using the >/=1.5 cut-off. Above 75 years of age, an alternative cut-off of >/=2.0 should be applied to achieve a classification accuracy for both patients with AD and control subjects that is clinically useful. CONCLUSION: Clinical, demographic and genetic variables can influence the classification of MTA cut-off scores, leading to misdiagnosis in some cases. These variables, in addition to the differential sensitivity and specificity of each cut-off, should be carefully considered when performing visual MTA assessment. :: Notes: Pereira, J B :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24118559 :: Author Address: Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden.

Differences in corpus callosum mid-sagittal area and subregional area changes were measured using an automated software-based method. Heterotopic gray matter deposits were automatically labeled and compared with corpus callosum changes. The spatial pattern of corpus callosum changes were interpreted in the context of the characteristic anterior-posterior development of the corpus callosum in healthy individuals. Individuals with periventricular nodular heterotopia were imaged at the Melbourne Brain Center or as part of the multi-site Epilepsy Phenome Genome project. Whole brain T1 weighted MRI was acquired in cases (n=48) and controls (n=663). The corpus callosum was segmented on the mid-sagittal plane using the software "yuki". Heterotopic gray matter and intracranial brain volume was measured using Freesurfer. Differences in corpus callosum area and subregional areas were assessed, as well as the relationship between corpus callosum area and heterotopic GM volume. The anterior-posterior distribution of corpus callosum changes and heterotopic GM nodules were quantified using a novel metric and compared with each other. Corpus callosum area was reduced by 14% in PVNH (p=1.59x10(-9)). The magnitude of the effect was least in the genu (7% reduction) and greatest in the isthmus and splenium (26% reduction). Individuals with higher heterotopic GM volume had a smaller corpus callosum. Heterotopic GM volume was highest in posterior brain regions, however there was no linear relationship between the anterior-posterior position of corpus callosum changes and PVNH nodules. Reduced corpus callosum area is strongly associated with PVNH, and is probably associated with abnormal brain development in this neurological disorder. The primarily posterior corpus callosum changes may inform our understanding of the etiology of PVNH. Our results suggest that interhemispheric pathways are affected in PVNH. :: Notes: Pardoe, Heath R :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25524841 :: Author Address: Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, Department of Neurology, New York University School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States.

If enlarging ventricles serve as a marker of faulty cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) clearance mechanisms, then a relationship may be demonstrable between increasing ventricular volume and decreasing levels of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) in CSF in preclinical and early AD. CSF biomarker data (Abeta, tau, and phosphorylated tau) as well as direct measurements of whole brain and ventricular volumes were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. The ratio of ventricular volume to whole brain volume was derived as a secondary independent measure. Baseline data were used for the group analyses of 288 subjects classified as being either normal (n=87), having the syndrome of mild cognitive impairment (n=136), or mild AD (n=65). Linear regression models were derived for each biomarker as the dependent variable, using the MRI volume measures and age as independent variables. For controls, ventricular volume was negatively associated with CSF Abeta in APOE epsilon4 positive subjects. A different pattern was seen in AD subjects, in whom ventricular volume was negatively associated with tau, but not Abeta in epsilon4 positive subjects. Increased ventricular volume may be associated with decreased levels of CSF Abeta in preclinical AD. The basis for the apparent effect of APOE epsilon4 genotype on the relationship of ventricular volume to Abeta and tau levels is unknown, but could involve altered CSF-blood-brain barrier function during the course of disease. :: Notes: Ott, Brian R :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20182051 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University, Providence, RI 02903, USA.

In this study, we investigated whether whole brain atrophy and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype are associated with the rate of functional decline in MCI. METHODS: Participants were 164 healthy controls, 258 MCI patients, and 103 patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD), enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. They underwent brain MRI scans, APOE genotyping, and completed up to six biannual Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ) assessments. Random effects regressions were used to examine trajectories of decline in FAQ across diagnostic groups, and to test the effects of ventricle-to-brain ratio (VBR) and APOE genotype on FAQ decline among MCI patients. RESULTS: Rate of decline in FAQ among MCI patients was intermediate between that of controls and mild AD patients. Patients with MCI who converted to mild AD declined faster than those who remained stable. Among MCI patients, increased VBR and possession of any APOE varepsilon4 allele were associated with faster rate of decline in FAQ. In addition, there was a significant VBR by APOE varepsilon4 interaction such that patients who were APOE varepsilon4 positive and had increased atrophy experienced the fastest decline in FAQ. CONCLUSIONS: Functional decline occurs in MCI, particularly among patients who progress to mild AD. Brain atrophy and APOE varepsilon4 positivity are associated with such declines, and patients who have elevated brain atrophy and are APOE varepsilon4 positive are at greatest risk of functional degradation. These findings highlight the value of genetic and volumetric MRI information as predictors of functional decline, and thus disease progression, in MCI. :: Notes: Okonkwo, Ozioma C :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20813341 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA. ozioma@jhmi.edu

OBJECTIVE: To generate and cross-validate a blood-based screener for AD that yields acceptable accuracy across both serum and plasma. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Analysis of serum biomarker proteins were conducted on 197 Alzheimer's disease (AD) participants and 199 control participants from the Texas Alzheimer's Research Consortium (TARC) with further analysis conducted on plasma proteins from 112 AD and 52 control participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The full algorithm was derived from a biomarker risk score, clinical lab (glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, homocysteine), and demographic (age, gender, education, APOE*E4 status) data. MAJOR OUTCOME MEASURES: Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: 11 proteins met our criteria and were utilized for the biomarker risk score. The random forest (RF) biomarker risk score from the TARC serum samples (training set) yielded adequate accuracy in the ADNI plasma sample (training set) (AUC = 0.70, sensitivity (SN) = 0.54 and specificity (SP) = 0.78), which was below that obtained from ADNI cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analyses (t-tau/Abeta ratio AUC = 0.92). However, the full algorithm yielded excellent accuracy (AUC = 0.88, SN = 0.75, and SP = 0.91). The likelihood ratio of having AD based on a positive test finding (LR+) = 7.03 (SE = 1.17; 95% CI = 4.49-14.47), the likelihood ratio of not having AD based on the algorithm (LR-) = 3.55 (SE = 1.15; 2.22-5.71), and the odds ratio of AD were calculated in the ADNI cohort (OR) = 28.70 (1.55; 95% CI = 11.86-69.47). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to create a blood-based screening algorithm that works across both serum and plasma that provides a comparable screening accuracy to that obtained from CSF analyses. :: Notes: O'Bryant, Sid E :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22163278 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, F.

The common mechanistic theory for this effect posits that cells have an innate tendency toward apoptotic or survival pathways, translating to increased risk for either neurodegeneration or cancer. However, it has been shown that cancer patients experience cognitive dysfunction pre- and post-treatment as well as alterations in cerebral gray matter density (GMD) on MRI. To further investigate these issues, we analyzed the association between cancer history (CA+/-) and age of AD onset, and the relationship between GMD and CA+/- status across diagnostic groups in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort study. Data was analyzed from 1609 participants with information on baseline cancer history and AD diagnosis, age of AD onset, and baseline MRI scans. Participants were CA+ (N = 503) and CA- (N = 1106) diagnosed with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), significant memory concerns (SMC), and cognitively normal older adults. As in previous studies, CA+ was inversely associated with AD at baseline (P = 0.025); interestingly, this effect appears to be driven by non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), the largest cancer category in this study (P = 0.001). CA+ was also associated with later age of AD onset (P < 0.001), independent of apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele status, and individuals with two prior cancers had later mean age of AD onset than those with one or no prior cancer (P < 0.001), suggesting an additive effect. Voxel-based morphometric analysis of GMD showed CA+ had lower GMD in the right superior frontal gyrus compared to CA- across diagnostic groups (P crit < 0.001, uncorrected); this cluster of lower GMD appeared to be driven by history of invasive cancer types, rather than skin cancer. Thus, while cancer history is associated with a measurable delay in AD onset independent of APOE epsilon4, the underlying mechanism does not appear to be cancer-related preservation of GMD. :: Notes: Nudelman, Kelly N H :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25400589 :: Author Address: Department of Medical and Molecular Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine Indianapolis, IN, USA ; Training in Research for Behavioral Oncology and Cancer Control, Indiana University School of Nursing Indianapolis, IN, USA ; Center for Neuroimaging, Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Indiana University School of Medicine Indianapolis, IN, USA.

Several imputation algorithms use reference panels with a larger set of genotyped markers to infer genotypes at ungenotyped marker locations. Our objective was to assess which method and reference panel was more accurate when carrying out imputation. We investigated the influence of choice of two most popular imputation methods, IMPUTE and MACH, on two reference panels from the HapMap and the 1000 Genomes Project. Our results indicated that for the HapMap, MACH consistently yielded more accurate imputation results than IMPUTE, while for the 1000 Genomes Project, IMPUTE performed slightly better. The best imputation results were achieved by IMPUTE with the combined reference panel (HapMap + 1000 Genomes Project). IMPUTE with the combined reference panel is a promising strategy for genotype imputation, which should facilitate fine-mapping for discovery as well as known disease-associated candidate regions. :: Notes: Nho, Kwangsik :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22195161 :: Author Address: Regenstrief Institute and Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.

Although the heritability of depression is estimated to be substantial, single nucleotide polymorphism-based genome-wide association studies of depressive symptoms have had limited success. In this study, we PERFORMED genome-wide gene- and pathway-based analyses of depressive symptom burden. Study participants included non-Hispanic Caucasian subjects (n = 6,884) from three independent cohorts, the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), and the Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS). Gene-based meta-analysis identified genome-wide significant associations (ANGPT4 and FAM110A, q-value = 0.026; GRM7-AS3 and LRFN5, q-value = 0.042). Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of association in 105 pathways, including multiple pathways related to ERK/MAPK signaling, GSK3 signaling in bipolar disorder, cell development, and immune activation and inflammation. GRM7, ANGPT4, and LRFN5 have been previously implicated in psychiatric disorders, including the GRM7 region displaying association with major depressive disorder. The ERK/MAPK signaling pathway is a known target of antidepressant drugs and has important roles in neuronal plasticity, and GSK3 signaling has been previously implicated in Alzheimer's disease and as a promising therapeutic target for depression. Our results warrant further investigation in independent and larger cohorts and add to the growing understanding of the genetics and pathobiology of depressive symptoms in aging and neurodegenerative disorders. In particular, the genes and pathways demonstrating association with depressive symptoms may be potential therapeutic targets for these symptoms in older adults. :: Notes: Nho, Kwangsik :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25690665 :: Author Address: Center for Neuroimaging, Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA Indiana Alzheimer Disease Center, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, USA.

Matched unrelated APOE epsilon3 homozygous male Caucasian participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were selected at the extremes of the 2-year longitudinal change distribution of hippocampal volume (eight subjects with rapid rates of atrophy and eight with slow/stable rates of atrophy). We identified 57 non-synonymous single nucleotide variants (SNVs) which were found exclusively in at least 4 of 8 subjects in the rapid atrophy group, but not in any of the 8 subjects in the slow atrophy group. Among these SNVs, the variants that accounted for the greatest group difference and were predicted in silico as 'probably damaging' missense variants were rs9610775 (CARD10) and rs1136410 (PARP1). To further investigate and extend the exome findings in a larger sample, we conducted quantitative trait analysis including whole-brain search in the remaining ADNI APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 group (N=315). Genetic variation within PARP1 and CARD10 was associated with rate of hippocampal neurodegeneration in APOE epsilon3/epsilon3. Meta-analysis across five independent cross sectional cohorts indicated that rs1136410 is also significantly associated with hippocampal volume in APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 individuals (N=923). Larger sequencing studies and longitudinal follow-up are needed for confirmation. The combination of next-generation sequencing and quantitative imaging phenotypes holds significant promise for discovery of variants involved in neurodegeneration. :: Notes: Nho, K :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23608917 :: Author Address: Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Center for Neuroimaging, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202-3082, USA.

This study compared (i) ventricular enlargement after six months in subjects with MCI, AD and normal elderly controls (NEC) in a multi-centre study, (ii) volumetric and cognitive changes between Apolipoprotein E genotypes, (iii) ventricular enlargement in subjects who progressed from MCI to AD, and (iv) sample sizes for multi-centre MCI and AD studies based on measures of ventricular enlargement. Three dimensional T(1)-weighted MRI and cognitive measures were acquired from 504 subjects (NEC n = 152, MCI n = 247 and AD n = 105) participating in the multi-centre Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Cerebral ventricular volume was quantified at baseline and after six months using semi-automated software. For the primary analysis of ventricle and neurocognitive measures, between group differences were evaluated using an analysis of covariance, and repeated measures t-tests were used for within group comparisons. For secondary analyses, all groups were dichotomized for Apolipoprotein E genotype based on the presence of an epsilon 4 polymorphism. In addition, the MCI group was dichotomized into those individuals who progressed to a clinical diagnosis of AD, and those subjects that remained stable with MCI after six months. Group differences on neurocognitive and ventricle measures were evaluated by independent t-tests. General sample size calculations were computed for all groups derived from ventricle measurements and neurocognitive scores. The AD group had greater ventricular enlargement compared to both subjects with MCI (P = 0.0004) and NEC (P < 0.0001), and subjects with MCI had a greater rate of ventricular enlargement compared to NEC (P = 0.0001). MCI subjects that progressed to clinical AD after six months had greater ventricular enlargement than stable MCI subjects (P = 0.0270). Ventricular enlargement was different between Apolipoprotein E genotypes within the AD group (P = 0.010). The number of subjects required to demonstrate a 20% change in ventricular enlargement was substantially lower than that required to demonstrate a 20% change in cognitive scores. Ventricular enlargement represents a feasible short-term marker of disease progression in subjects with MCI and subjects with AD for multi-centre studies. :: Notes: Nestor, Sean M :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18669512 :: Author Address: Department of Medical Biophysics, Centre for Functional and Metabolic Mapping, Robarts Research Institute, University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada.

However, until recently, variants at few other loci with statistically significant associations have replicated across studies. The present study combines data on 483,399 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a previously reported GWAS of 492 LOAD cases and 496 controls and from an independent set of 439 LOAD cases and 608 controls to strengthen power to identify novel genetic association signals. Associations exceeding the experiment-wide significance threshold (alpha=1.03x10(-7)) were replicated in an additional 1,338 cases and 2,003 controls. As expected, these analyses unequivocally confirmed APOE's risk effect (rs2075650, P=1.9x10(-36)). Additionally, the SNP rs11754661 at 151.2 Mb of chromosome 6q25.1 in the gene MTHFD1L (which encodes the methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+ dependent) 1-like protein) was significantly associated with LOAD (P=4.70x10(-8); Bonferroni-corrected P=0.022). Subsequent genotyping of SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (r2>0.8) with rs11754661 identified statistically significant associations in multiple SNPs (rs803424, P=0.016; rs2073067, P=0.03; rs2072064, P=0.035), reducing the likelihood of association due to genotyping error. In the replication case-control set, we observed an association of rs11754661 in the same direction as the previous association at P=0.002 (P=1.90x10(-10) in combined analysis of discovery and replication sets), with associations of similar statistical significance at several adjacent SNPs (rs17349743, P=0.005; rs803422, P=0.004). In summary, we observed and replicated a novel statistically significant association in MTHFD1L, a gene involved in the tetrahydrofolate synthesis pathway. This finding is noteworthy, as MTHFD1L may play a role in the generation of methionine from homocysteine and influence homocysteine-related pathways and as levels of homocysteine are a significant risk factor for LOAD development. :: Notes: Naj, Adam C :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=20885792 :: Author Address: Dr. John T.

METHODS: We used 18F-florbetapir F18 PET imaging to quantify neuritic beta-amyloid plaque density across four cortical regions in 602 elderly (55-94 years) subjects from the national ADNI biomarker study. The group comprised of 194 normal elderly, 212 early mild cognitive impairment [EMCI], 132 late mild cognitive impairment [LMCI], and 64 mild Alzheimer's (AD). FINDINGS: In a model incorporating multiple predictive factors, the effect of apolipoprotein E epsilon4 and diagnosis was significant on all four cortical regions. The highest signals were seen in cingulate followed by frontal and parietal with lowest signals in temporal lobe (p<0.0001). The effect of apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (Cohen's D 0.96) on beta-amyloid plaque density was approximately twice as large as the effect of a diagnosis of AD (Cohen's D 0.51) and thrice as large as the effect of a diagnosis of LMCI (Cohen's D 0.34) (p<0.0001). Surprisingly, ApoE epsilon4+ normal controls had greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than epsilon4- EMCI and epsilon4- LMCI (p<0.0001, p=0.0009) and showed higher, though non-significant, mean value than epsilon4- AD patients (p<0.27). ApoE epsilon4+ EMCI and LMCI subjects had significantly greater mean plaque density across all cortical regions than epsilon4- AD patients (p<0.027, p<0.0001). INTERPRETATION: Neuritic amyloid plaque load across progressive clinical stages of AD varies strongly by ApoE4 genotype. These findings support the need for better pathology-based and supported diagnosis in routine practice. Our data also provides additional evidence for a temporal offset between amyloid deposition and clinically relevant symptoms. :: Notes: Murphy, Kelly R :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23624169 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry, Duke University Health System, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.

This study investigates whether these polymorphisms affect brain structure in 188 elderly controls and 318 AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Nominally signficant associations were dependent on APOE epsilon4 carrier status. In APOE epsilon4 carriers, the V and A alleles, both of which decrease CETP and increase HDL, associated with greater baseline cortical thickness and less 12-month atrophy in the medial temporal lobe. Conversely, in APOE epsilon4 non-carriers, the I allele, which increases CETP and decreases HDL, associated with greater baseline thickness, less atrophy and lower risk of dementia. These results suggest CETP may contribute to the genetic variability of brain structure and dementia susceptibility in an APOE-dependent manner. :: Notes: Murphy, Elizabeth A :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21892657 :: Author Address: Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, CA, USA.

OBJECTIVE: We compared the differences in accuracy in differentiating stable mild cognitive impairment (S-MCI) and progressive MCI (P-MCI) obtained from different data combinations using the DSI. METHODS: We investigated 212 cases with S-MCI and 165 cases with P-MCI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Data from neuropsychological tests, cerebrospinal fluid, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) were included. RESULTS: The combination of all parameters gave the highest accuracy (accuracy 0.70, sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.68). In the different categories, neuropsychological tests (0.65, 0.65, 0.65) and hippocampal volumetry (0.66, 0.66, 0.66) achieved the highest accuracy. CONCLUSION: In addition to neuropsychological testing, MRI is recommended to be included for differentiating S-MCI from P-MCI. APOE genotype, CSF and PET may provide some additional information. :: Notes: Munoz-Ruiz, Miguel Angel :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23969422 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.

We evaluated data from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. We assigned people with AD to dysexecutive and amnesic subgroups using single indicators, and analogously using the ADNI-Mem and ADNI-EF composite scores developed using modern psychometric approaches. We evaluated associations between subgroup membership, APOE genotype, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with AD, and brain vascular disease defined as white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and MRI-identified infarcts. We hypothesized that APOE epsilon4 and alleles associated with higher risk for AD would predict amnesic subgroup membership; alleles associated with higher WMH or infarct burden would predict dysexecutive subgroup membership. Classification agreement between the two approaches was only fair (kappa = 0.23). There was no relationship between APOE alleles and the dysexecutive or amnesic phenotypes defined by either categorization approach. There were 58 AD-related and 25 WMH- or infarct-related SNPs for which odds ratios were > 1.5 or < 0.67 for dysexecutive vs. amnesic subgroup defined by either categorization approach. Higher proportions of SNPs had odds ratios in the hypothesized direction for the subgroups defined by the modern psychometric approach for AD-related (58 % vs. 38 %, p-value < 0.001) and brain vascular disease-related SNPs (48 vs. 32 %, p-value = 0.01). Genetic variation may underlie differential performance in memory and executive functioning among people with AD. Modern psychometric composite scores produced group assignments with more SNP associations in the hypothesized direction. :: Notes: Mukherjee, Shubhabrata :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23161456 :: Author Address: Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. smukherj@u.washington.edu

Here, we report gene- and pathway-based analyses of the same resilience phenotype, using an optimal SNP-set (Sequence) Kernel Association Test (SKAT) for gene-based analyses (conservative threshold for genome-wide significance = 0.05/18,123 = 2.8 x 10(-6)) and the gene-set enrichment package GSA-SNP for biological pathway analyses (False discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). Gene-based analyses found a genome-wide significant association between RNASE13 and EF resilience (p = 1.33 x 10(-7)). Genetic pathways involved with dendritic/neuron spine, presynaptic membrane, postsynaptic density, etc., were enriched with association to EF resilience.

Our objective was to identify genetic variation associated with executive functioning resilience. We computed residuals from regression models of executive functioning, adjusting for age, sex, education, Hachinski score, and MRI findings (lacunes, cortical thickness, volumes of white matter hyperintensities and hippocampus). We estimated heritability and analyzed these residuals in models for each SNP. We further evaluated our most promising SNP result by evaluating cis-associations with brain levels of nearby (+/-100 kb) genes from a companion data set, and comparing expression levels in cortex and cerebellum from decedents with AD with those from other non-AD diseases. Complete data were available for 750 ADNI participants of European descent. Executive functioning resilience was highly heritable (H(2) = 0.76; S.E. = 0.44). rs3748348 on chromosome 14 in the region of RNASE13 was associated with executive functioning resilience (p-value = 4.31 x 10(-)(7)). rs3748348 is in strong linkage disequilibrium (D' of 1.00 and 0.96) with SNPs that map to TPPP2, a member of the alpha-synuclein family of proteins. We identified nominally significant associations between rs3748348 and expression levels of three genes (FLJ10357, RNASE2, and NDRG2). The strongest association was for FLJ10357 in cortex, which also had the most significant difference in expression between AD and non-AD brains, with greater expression in cortex of decedents with AD (p-value = 7 x 10(-)(7)). Further research is warranted to determine whether this signal can be replicated and whether other loci may be associated with cognitive resilience. :: Notes: Mukherjee, Shubhabrata :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22711244 :: Author Address: Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Box 359780, 325 Ninth Avenue, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.

It can be used to organize and integrate existing data from heterogeneous projects as well as data from ongoing studies. It has been conceived to guide and assist the researcher throughout the entire research process, integrating all relevant types of data across modalities (e.g., brain imaging, clinical, and genetic data). TheHiveDB is a modern activity and resource management system capable of scheduling image processing on both private compute resources and the cloud. The activity component supports common image archival and management tasks as well as established pipeline processing (e.g., Freesurfer for extraction of scalar measures from magnetic resonance images). Furthermore, via theHiveDB activity system algorithm developers may grant access to virtual machines hosting versioned releases of their tools to collaborators and the imaging community. The application of theHiveDB is illustrated with a brief use case based on organizing, processing, and analyzing data from the publically available Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. :: Notes: Muehlboeck, J-Sebastian :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24432000 :: Author Address: Department of Neuroimaging, Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London London, UK ; Department of Neurobiology, Care Sciences and Society, Karolinska Institutet Stockholm, Sweden ; J-S Muehlboeck Inc., Montreal QC, Canada.

In one of the largest brain mapping studies to date, we mapped the 3D profile of hippocampal degeneration over time in 490 subjects scanned twice with brain MRI over a 1-year interval (980 scans). We examined baseline and 1-year follow-up scans of 97 AD subjects (49 males/48 females), 148 healthy control subjects (75 males/73 females), and 245 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; 160 males/85 females). We used our previously validated automated segmentation method, based on AdaBoost, to create 3D hippocampal surface models in all 980 scans. Hippocampal volume loss rates increased with worsening diagnosis (normal=0.66%/year; MCI=3.12%/year; AD=5.59%/year), and correlated with both baseline and interval changes in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores and global and sum-of-boxes Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) scores. Surface-based statistical maps visualized a selective profile of ongoing atrophy in all three diagnostic groups. Healthy controls carrying the ApoE4 gene atrophied faster than non-carriers, while more educated controls atrophied more slowly; converters from MCI to AD showed faster atrophy than non-converters. Hippocampal loss rates can be rapidly mapped, and they track cognitive decline closely enough to be used as surrogate markers of Alzheimer's disease in drug trials. They also reveal genetically greater atrophy in cognitively intact subjects. :: Notes: Morra, Jonathan H :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19041724 :: Author Address: Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Dept. of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine, Neuroscience Research Building 225E, 635 Charles Young Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1769, USA.

After training the classifier on 21 hand-labeled expert segmentations, we created binary maps of the hippocampus for three age- and sex-matched groups: 100 subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), 200 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 100 elderly controls (mean age: 75.84; SD: 6.64). Hippocampal traces were converted to parametric surface meshes and a radial atrophy mapping technique was used to compute average surface models and local statistics of atrophy. Surface-based statistical maps visualized links between regional atrophy and diagnosis (MCI versus controls: P = 0.008; MCI versus AD: P = 0.001), mini-mental state exam (MMSE) scores, and global and sum-of-boxes clinical dementia rating scores (CDR; all P < 0.0001, corrected). Right but not left hippocampal atrophy was associated with geriatric depression scores (P = 0.004, corrected); hippocampal atrophy was not associated with subsequent decline in MMSE and CDR scores, educational level, ApoE genotype, systolic or diastolic blood pressure measures, or homocysteine. We gradually reduced sample sizes and used false discovery rate curves to examine the method's power to detect associations with diagnosis and cognition in smaller samples. Forty subjects were sufficient to discriminate AD from normal and correlate atrophy with CDR scores; 104, 200, and 304 subjects, respectively, were required to correlate MMSE with atrophy, to distinguish MCI from normal, and MCI from AD. :: Notes: Morra, Jonathan H :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19172649 :: Author Address: Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Department of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, California 90095-1769, USA.

METHODS: Data from 490 CNs were aggregated across 3 observational cohort studies (Harvard Aging Brain Study, Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Ageing; median age = 75.0 years, 255 female), and the contributions of APOE epsilon4 and Abeta on longitudinal change over a median of 1.49 years were examined. Cognitive decline was assessed with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Logical Memory (immediate and delayed recall scores). RESULTS: High Abeta participants were more likely to be APOE epsilon4+ than low Abeta participants. CNs who were both high Abeta and APOE epsilon4+ showed greater decline in Logical Memory immediate recall (p < 0.087), Logical Memory delayed recall (p < 0.024), and MMSE (p < 0.034) compared to all other groups (low Abeta/APOE epsilon4-, low Abeta/APOE epsilon4+, and high Abeta/APOE epsilon4-). No other pairwise contrast was significant for any cognitive measure. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically normal individuals who are APOE epsilon4+ and have high Abeta showed the highest cognitive decline. These results suggest that Abeta and APOE epsilon4 are not redundant contributors of decline in aging but rather interact to promote decline during the short follow-up period examined in this study. Longer follow-up periods will be essential to fully elucidate the influence of Alzheimer disease risk factors on cognitive decline in aging. :: Notes: Mormino, Elizabeth C :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24748674 :: Author Address: From the Departments of Neurology (E.C.M., A.P.S., D.M.R., K.A.J., R.A.S.), Radiology (T.H., A.P.S., K.A.J., R.A.S.), and Psychiatry (A.P.S., A.W.), and the Division of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Department of Radiology (K.A.J.), Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School; the Department of Biostatistics (R.A.B.), Harvard School of Public Health, Boston; the Athinoula A.

METHODS: Nine of the subjects had EO-AD (Alzheimer's disease) and 27 had EO-MCI (mild cognitive impairment). The 15 most important neuroimaging markers were extracted with the Global Shape Analysis (GSA) Pipeline workflow. The 20 most significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were chosen and were associated with specific neuroimaging biomarkers. RESULTS: We identified associations between the neuroimaging phenotypes and genotypes for a total of 36 subjects. Our results for all the subjects taken together showed the most significant associations between rs7718456 and L_hippocampus (volume), and between rs7718456 and R_hippocampus (volume). For the 27 MCI subjects, we found the most significant associations between rs6446443 and R_superior_frontal_gyrus (volume), and between rs17029131 and L_Precuneus (volume). For the nine AD subjects, we found the most significant associations between rs16964473 and L_rectus gyrus (surface area), and between rs12972537 and L_rectus_gyrus (surface area). CONCLUSION: We observed significant correlations between the SNPs and the neuroimaging phenotypes in the 36 EO subjects in terms of neuroimaging genetics. However, larger sample sizes are needed to ensure that the effects will be detectable for a reasonable false-positive error rate using the GSA and Plink Pipeline workflows. :: Notes: Moon, Seok Woo :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25670955 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry, Konkuk University School of Medicine, Chungju, Republic of Korea.

We conducted a 2-stage GWAS for AD-related quantitative measures of hippocampal volume (HV), total cerebral volume (TCV), and white matter hyperintensities (WMH). METHODS: Brain magnetic resonance imaging measures of HV, TCV, and WMH were obtained from 981 Caucasian and 419 African American AD cases and their cognitively normal siblings in the MIRAGE (Multi Institutional Research in Alzheimer's Genetic Epidemiology) Study, and from 168 AD cases, 336 individuals with mild cognitive impairment, and 188 controls in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative Study. A GWAS for each trait was conducted in the 2 Caucasian data sets in stage 1. Results from the 2 data sets were combined by meta-analysis. In stage 2, 1 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) from each region that was nominally significant in each data set (p < 0.05) and strongly associated in both data sets (p < 1.0 x 10(-5)) was evaluated in the African American data set. RESULTS: Twenty-two markers (14 for HV, 3 for TCV, and 5 for WMH) from distinct regions met criteria for evaluation in stage 2. Novel genome-wide significant associations (p < 5.0 x 10(-8)) were attained for HV with SNPs in the APOE, F5/SELP, LHFP, and GCFC2 gene regions. All of these associations were supported by evidence in each data set. Associations with different SNPs in the same gene (p < 1 x 10(-5) in Caucasians and p < 2.2 x 10(-4) in African Americans) were also observed for PICALM with HV, SYNPR with TCV, and TTC27 with WMH. INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates the efficacy of endophenotypes for broadening our understanding of the genetic basis of AD. :: Notes: Melville, Scott A :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22745009 :: Author Address: Department of Medicine, Boston University School of Medicine, MA, USA.

The aim of the current study was to overcome these limitations in a bi-multivariate fashion by linking intermediate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) phenotypes with a genome-wide sample of common single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants. We compared associations between 94 different brain regions of interest derived from structural MRI scans and 533,872 genome-wide SNPs using a novel multivariate statistical procedure, parallel-independent component analysis, in a large, national multi-center subject cohort. The study included 209 elderly healthy controls, 367 subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment and 181 with mild, early-stage LOAD, all of them Caucasian adults, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. Imaging was performed on comparable 1.5 T scanners at over 50 sites in the USA/Canada. Four primary "genetic components" were associated significantly with a single structural network including all regions involved neuropathologically in LOAD. Pathway analysis suggested that each component included several genes already known to contribute to LOAD risk (e.g. APOE4) or involved in pathologic processes contributing to the disorder, including inflammation, diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. In addition significant novel genes identified included ZNF673, VPS13, SLC9A7, ATP5G2 and SHROOM2. Unlike conventional analyses, this multivariate approach identified distinct groups of genes that are plausibly linked in physiologic pathways, perhaps epistatically. Further, the study exemplifies the value of this novel approach to explore large-scale data sets involving high-dimensional gene and endophenotype data. :: Notes: Meda, Shashwath A :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22245343 :: Author Address: Olin Neuropsychiatric Research Center, Hartford Hospital/IOL, Hartford, CT 06106, USA.

In the current study, we use quantitative intermediate phenotypes derived from magnetic resonance imaging data available from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, and we test for association with gene-gene interactions within biological pathways. Regional brain volumes from the hippocampus (HIP) and entorhinal cortex (EC) were estimated from baseline and 12-month magnetic resonance imaging scans. Approximately 560,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were available genome-wide. We tested all pairwise SNP-SNP interactions (approximately 151 million) within 212 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways for association with 12-month regional atrophy rates using linear regression, with sex, APOE epsilon4 carrier status, age, education, and clinical status as covariates. A total of 109 SNP-SNP interactions were associated with right HIP atrophy, and 125 were associated with right EC atrophy. Enrichment analysis indicated significant SNP-SNP interactions were overrepresented in the calcium signaling and axon guidance pathways for both HIP and EC atrophy and in the ErbB signaling pathway for HIP atrophy. :: Notes: Meda, Shashwath A :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23107432 :: Author Address: Center for Human Genetics and Research, Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN, USA.

Treatable effects were defined as absolute change versus change relative to healthy controls (HCs). Data from 168 HC and 299 MCI participants were analyzed to determine sample sizes required to detect 25% slowing in mean rate of decline using global function, cognitive function, and structural measures as outcome variables. Reductions in estimated sample sizes of 10% to 43% were observed using the genetic enrichment strategy; reductions of 43% to 60% were observed with the neuroimaging enrichment strategy. Sample sizes needed to detect slowing in rate of atrophy in MCI relative to HC were dramatically larger than those needed to detect absolute change in atrophy rates. Constraining enrollment to MCI subjects with predictive atrophy on a screening MRI scan could improve the efficiency of clinical trials.

Aside from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid42 (Abeta42) and tau, no studies have tested associations between CSF proteins and AD-like brain atrophy. We studied 90 healthy elders, who underwent lumbar puncture at baseline, and serial magnetic resonance imaging scans for up to 4 years. We tested statistical effects of baseline CSF proteins (N = 70 proteins related to Abeta42-metabolism, microglial activity, and synaptic/neuronal function) on atrophy rates in 7 AD-related regions. Besides the effects of Abeta42 and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) that were seen in several regions, novel CSF proteins were found to have effects in inferior and middle temporal cortex (including apolipoprotein CIII, apolipoprotein D, and apolipoprotein H). Several proteins (including S100beta and matrix metalloproteinase-3) had effects that depended on the presence of brain Abeta pathology, as measured by CSF Abeta42. Other proteins (including P-tau and apolipoprotein D) had effects even after adjusting for CSF Abeta42. The statistical effects in this exploratory study were mild and not significant after correction for multiple comparisons, but some of the identified proteins may be associated with brain atrophy in healthy persons.

New methods are needed to translate them into knowledge that is applicable in healthcare. Multiscale modeling has emerged as a way to describe systems that are the source of experimental data. Usually, a multiscale model is built by combining distinct models of several scales, integrating, e.g., genetic, molecular, structural, and neuropsychological models into a composite representation. We present a novel generic clinical decision support system, which models a patient's disease state statistically from heterogeneous multiscale data. Its goal is to aid in diagnostic work by analyzing all available patient data and highlighting the relevant information to the clinician. The system is evaluated by applying it to several medical datasets and demonstrated by implementing a novel clinical decision support tool for early prediction of Alzheimer's disease. :: Notes: Mattila, Jussi :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21990325 :: Author Address: VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Tampere, Finland. jussi.mattila@vtt.fi

Because of the similarities between Alzheimer's disease and sporadic inclusion body myositis (s-IBM), and the importance of amyloid-beta and mitochondrial changes in s-IBM, we investigated whether variation in poly-T repeat lengths in rs10524523 also influence susceptibility and age at onset in a cohort of 90 Caucasian s-IBM patients (55 males; age 69.1 +/- 9.6). In carriers of APOE epsilon3/epsilon3 or epsilon3/epsilon4, genotypes with a very long (VL) poly-T repeat were under-represented in s-IBM compared to controls and were associated with a later age at symptom onset, suggesting that these genotypes may be protective. Our study is the first to suggest that polymorphisms in genes controlling mitochondrial function can influence susceptibility to s-IBM and have disease modifying effects. However, further studies in other s-IBM populations are needed to confirm these findings, as well as expression studies of different TOMM40 alleles in muscle tissue. :: Notes: Mastaglia, F L :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24103330 :: Author Address: Australian Neuro-Muscular Research Institute, Centre for Neuromuscular and Neurological Disorders, The University of Western Australia, Queen Elizabeth II Medical Centre, Perth, Western Australia, Australia; Institute for Immunology & Infectious Diseases, Murdoch University, Western Australia, Australia.

Studies have shown that multimodal biomarkers provide better diagnosis accuracy of AD and MCI than unimodal biomarkers, but their construction has been based on traditional statistical approaches. The objective of this work was the creation of accurate AD and MCI diagnostic multimodal biomarkers using advanced bioinformatics tools. The biomarkers were created by exploring multimodal combinations of features using machine learning techniques. Data was obtained from the ADNI database. The baseline information (e.g. MRI analyses, PET analyses and laboratory essays) from AD, MCI and healthy control (HC) subjects with available diagnosis up to June2012 was mined for case/controls candidates. The data mining yielded 47 HC, 83 MCI and 43 AD subjects for biomarker creation. Each subject was characterized by at least 980 ADNI features. A genetic algorithm feature selection strategy was used to obtain compact and accurate cross-validated nearest centroid biomarkers. The biomarkers achieved training classification accuracies of 0.983, 0.871 and 0.917 for HC vs. AD, HC vs. MCI and MCI vs. AD respectively. The constructed biomarkers were relatively compact: from 5 to 11 features. Those multimodal biomarkers included several widely accepted univariate biomarkers and novel image and biochemical features. Multimodal biomarkers constructed from previously and non-previously AD associated features showed improved diagnostic performance when compared to those based solely on previously AD associated features. © 2013 SPIE. :: Notes: Conference code: 97193 :: URL: http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84878410264&partnerID=40&md5=cfd0294a3965adb9790284ab25f24b6b :: Author Address: Cátedra de Bioinformática, Tecnológico de Monterrey, Monterrey Nuevo León, Mexico

METHODS: MRI scans from all available visits in ADNI (148 AD, 307 MCI, 167 controls) were used. MCI subjects were divided into "progressors" (MCI-P) if diagnosed with AD within 36 months or "stable" (MCI-S) if a diagnosis of MCI was maintained. A joint multi-level mixed-effect linear regression model was used to analyse the effect of epsilon4 carrier-status on hippocampal and whole-brain atrophy rates, adjusting for age, gender, MMSE and brain-to-intracranial volume ratio. The difference in hippocampal rates between epsilon4 carriers and non-carriers after adjustment for concurrent whole-brain atrophy rate was then calculated. RESULTS: Mean adjusted hippocampal atrophy rates in epsilon4 carriers were significantly higher in AD, MCI-P and MCI-S (p</=0.011, all tests) compared with epsilon4 non-carriers. After adjustment for whole-brain atrophy rate, the difference in mean adjusted hippocampal atrophy rate between epsilon4 carriers and non-carriers was reduced but remained statistically significant in AD and MCI-P. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the APOE epsilon4 allele drives atrophy to the medial-temporal lobe region in AD. :: Notes: Manning, Emily N :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24878738 :: Author Address: Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, London, United Kingdom.

We show that leptin levels in CSF are unchanged as subjects progress to AD. However, in AD hippocampus, leptin signalling was decreased and leptin localization was shifted, being more abundant in reactive astrocytes and less in neurons. Similar translocation of leptin was found in brains from Tg2576 and apoE4 mice. Moreover, an enhancement of leptin receptors was found in hippocampus of young Tg2576 mice and in primary astrocytes and neurons treated with Abeta1-42 . In contrast, old Tg2576 mice showed decreased leptin receptors levels. Similar findings to those seen in Tg2576 mice were found in apoE4, but not in apoE3 mice. These results suggest that leptin levels are intact, but leptin signalling is impaired in AD. Thus, Abeta accumulation and apoE4 genotype result in a transient enhancement of leptin signalling that might lead to a leptin resistance state over time. :: Notes: Maioli, Silvia :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25453257 :: Author Address: Karolinska Institutet, Department of Neurobiology Care Sciences and Society, Center for Alzheimer Research, Division for Neurogeriatrics, Stockholm, Sweden.

METHODS: Data from 405 MCI participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study were analyzed. Participants were evaluated at baseline and at 6-month intervals over 2 years. Severity of depressive symptoms was rated utilizing the Geriatric Depression Scale. Disability was assessed utilizing the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ). Other clinical variables included white matter lesion (WML) and intracranial brain (ICV) volumes derived from magnetic resonance imaging, ratings of overall cognitive function (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, ADAS), and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) status. Demographic variables included age, education, and gender. RESULTS: SSD individuals had a lower volume of WML and higher frequency of ApoE epsilon4 alleles than nondepressed participants but the two groups did not differ with respect to other clinical or demographic variables. At baseline, SSD individuals were 1.77 times more likely to have poorer FAQ scores than individuals with no symptoms of depression after controlling for the effect of cognitive functioning, ICV, WML, and ApoE status. The presence of SSD at baseline was not associated with a poorer course of disability outcomes, cognitive functioning, or conversion to dementia over 24 months. CONCLUSIONS: SSD demonstrated a significant impact on disability for MCI individuals, who are also at high risk for functional limitations related to neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, the treatment of SSD may represent a significant avenue to reduce the burden of disability in this vulnerable patient population. :: Notes: Mackin, R Scott :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23567388 :: Author Address: Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Veterans Administration Medical Center, San Francisco, CA; Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco, CA.

In addition to being far greater than in most other species, the volume of the human brain exhibits extensive variation and distinct sexual dimorphism in the general population. However, little is known about the genetic mechanisms underlying normal variation as well as the observed sex difference in human brain volume. Here we show that interleukin-3 (IL3) is strongly associated with brain volume variation in four genetically divergent populations. We identified a sequence polymorphism (rs31480) in the IL3 promoter which alters the expression of IL3 by affecting the binding affinity of transcription factor SP1. Further analysis indicated that IL3 and its receptors are continuously expressed in the developing mouse brain, reaching highest levels at postnatal day 1-4. Furthermore, we found IL3 receptor alpha (IL3RA) was mainly expressed in neural progenitors and neurons, and IL3 could promote proliferation and survival of the neural progenitors. The expression level of IL3 thus played pivotal roles in the expansion and maintenance of the neural progenitor pool and the number of surviving neurons. Moreover, we found that IL3 activated both estrogen receptors, but estrogen didn't directly regulate the expression of IL3. Our results demonstrate that genetic variation in the IL3 promoter regulates human brain volume and reveals novel roles of IL3 in regulating brain development. :: Notes: Luo, Xiong-jian :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23226269 :: Author Address: State Key Laboratory of Genetic Resources and Evolution, Kunming Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming, Yunnan, China.

We aimed to investigate the clinical presentation, neuropsychological profile, and regional pattern of gray matter and white matter loss associated with the TREM2 variant p.R47H, and to establish which regions best differentiate p.R47H carriers from noncarriers in 2 sample sets (Spanish and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, ADNI1). This was a cross-sectional study including a total number of 16 TREM2 p.R47H carriers diagnosed with AD or mild cognitive impairment, 75 AD p.R47H noncarriers and 75 cognitively intact TREM2 p.R47H noncarriers. Spanish AD TREM2 p.R47H carriers showed apraxia (9 of 9) and psychiatric symptoms such as personality changes, anxiety, paranoia, or fears more frequently than in AD noncarriers (corrected p = 0.039). For gray matter and white matter volumetric brain magnetic resonance imaging voxelwise analyses, we used statistical parametric mapping (SPM8) based on the General Linear Model. We used 3 different design matrices with a full factorial design. Voxel-based morphometry analyses were performed separately in the 2 sample sets. The absence of interset statistical differences allowed us to perform joint and conjunction analyses. Independent voxel-based morphometry analysis of the Spanish set as well as conjunction and joint analyses revealed substantial gray matter loss in orbitofrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex with relative preservation of parietal lobes in AD and/or mild cognitive impairment TREM2 p.R47H carriers, suggesting that TREM2 p.R47H variant is associated with certain clinical and neuroimaging AD features in addition to the increased TREM2 p.R47H atrophy in temporal lobes as described previously. The high frequency of pathologic behavioral symptoms, combined with a preferential frontobasal gray matter cortical loss, suggests that frontobasal and temporal regions could be more susceptible to the deleterious biological effects of the TREM2 variant p.R47H. :: Notes: Luis, Elkin O :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25027412 :: Author Address: Neuroimaging Laboratory, Division of Neurosciences, Center for Applied Medical Research (CIMA), University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain.

METHODS: Subjects with AD dementia from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with at least 1 amyloid biomarker (n = 211) were included in this report. Biomarker data from CSF Abeta42, amyloid PET, fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, and MRI were examined. The biomarker results were assessed on a per-patient basis and the subject categorization as defined in the NIA-AA workgroup guidelines was determined. RESULTS: When using a requirement that subjects have a positive amyloid biomarker and single neuronal injury marker having an AD pattern, 87% (48% for both neuronal injury biomarkers) of the subjects could be categorized as "high probability" for AD. Amyloid status of the combined Pittsburgh compound B-PET and CSF results showed an amyloid-negative rate of 10% in the AD group. In the ADNI AD group, 5 of 92 subjects fit the category "dementia unlikely due to AD" when at least one neuronal injury marker was negative. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of subjects with AD dementia in ADNI may be categorized more definitively as high-probability AD using the proposed biomarker scheme in the NIA-AA criteria. A minority of subjects may be excluded from the diagnosis of AD by using biomarkers in clinically categorized AD subjects. In a well-defined AD dementia population, significant biomarker inconsistency can be seen on a per-patient basis. :: Notes: Lowe, Val J :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23645596 :: Author Address: Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA. vlowe@mayo.edu

We included (1) 133 patients from the German Dementia Competence Network (71 +/- 8 years; 50% females; Mini Mental State Examination [MMSE], 24 +/- 3); (2) 83 patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (75 +/- 8 years; 45% females; MMSE, 24 +/- 2); and (3) 452 patients from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort 66 +/- 8 years; 47% females; MMSE, 20 +/- 5). As endophenotype markers we used cognitive tests, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers amyloid-beta, total tau (tau), tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, and hippocampal atrophy. We measured 19 SORL1 SNP alleles. Genotype-endophenotype associations were determined by linear regression analyses. There was an association between rs2070045-G allele and increased CSF-tau and more hippocampal atrophy. Additionally, haplotype-based analyses revealed an association between haplotype rs11218340-A/rs3824966-G/rs3824968-A and higher CSF-tau and CSF-tau phosphorylated at threonine 181. In conclusion, we found that SORL1 SNP rs2070045-G allele was related to CSF-tau and hippocampal atrophy, 2 endophenotype markers of AD, suggesting that SORL1 may be implicated in the downstream pathology in AD. :: Notes: Louwersheimer, Eva :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25659857 :: Author Address: Alzheimer Center and Department of Neurology, Neuroscience Campus Amsterdam, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

A number of studies in human have recently shown that genetic factors significantly contribute gene expression variation. In contrast, very little is known about the genetic basis of variation in protein abundance in man. Here, we assayed the abundance levels of proteins in plasma from 96 elderly Europeans using a new aptamer-based proteomic technology and performed genome-wide local (cis-) regulatory association analysis to identify protein quantitative trait loci (pQTL). We detected robust cis-associations for 60 proteins at a false discovery rate of 5%. The most highly significant single nucleotide polymorphism detected was rs7021589 (false discovery rate, 2.5 x 10(-12)), mapped within the gene coding sequence of Tenascin C (TNC). Importantly, we identified evidence of cis-regulatory variation for 20 previously disease-associated genes encoding protein, including variants with strong evidence of disease association show significant association with protein abundance levels. These results demonstrate that common genetic variants contribute to the differences in protein abundance levels in human plasma. Identification of pQTLs will significantly enhance our ability to discover and comprehend the biological and functional consequences of loci identified from genome-wide association study of complex traits. This is the first large-scale genetic association study of proteins in plasma measured using a novel, highly multiplexed slow off-rate modified aptamer (SOMAmer) proteomic platform. :: Notes: Lourdusamy, Anbarasu :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22595970 :: Author Address: NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health, South London, UK. anbarasu.lourdusamy@kcl.ac.uk

Whether these markers have biological influence on Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology is not known. We thus aimed to investigate the effect of cognitive reserve proxies on longitudinal change of AD biomarkers. A total of 819 participants with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and mild AD were enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and followed up with repeated measures of cerebrospinal fluid, positron emission tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers. Generalized estimating equations were used to assess whether biomarker rates of change were modified by reserve proxies. Cerebrospinal fluid Abeta42 decline was slower in normal cognition participants with higher cognitive reserve indexed by education, occupation, and American National Adult Reading Test (ANART). The decline of [F] fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography uptake was slower in AD participants with better performance on the ANART. Education, occupation, and ANART did not modify the rates of magnetic resonance imaging hippocampal atrophy in any group. These findings remained unchanged after accounting for APOE 4, longitudinal missing data, and baseline cognitive performance. Higher levels of reserve markers may slow the rate of amyloid deposition before cognitive impairment and preserve glucose metabolism at the dementia stage over the course of AD pathologic progression. :: Notes: Lo, Raymond Y :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23552443 :: Author Address: *Department of Neurology, Buddhist Tzu Chi General Hospital daggerCollege of Medicine, Tzu Chi University, Hualien, Taiwan double daggerDivision of Epidemiology, School of Public Health section signHelen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California parallelLife Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkeley, CA.

METHODS: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a clinic-based, multicenter, longitudinal study with blood, CSF, PET, and MRI scans repeatedly measured in 229 participants with normal cognition (NC), 397 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 193 with mild AD during 2005-2007. We used univariate and multivariable logistic regression models to examine the associations between baseline demographic/clinical features and loss of biomarker follow-ups in ADNI. RESULTS: CSF studies tended to recruit and retain patients with MCI with more AD-like features, including lower levels of baseline CSF Abeta(42). Depression was the major predictor for MCI dropouts, while family history of AD kept more patients with AD enrolled in PET and MRI studies. Poor cognitive performance was associated with loss of follow-up in most biomarker studies, even among NC participants. The presence of vascular risk factors seemed more critical than cognitive function for predicting dropouts in AD. CONCLUSION: The missing data are not missing completely at random in ADNI and likely conditional on certain features in addition to cognitive function. Missing data predictors vary across biomarkers and even MCI and AD groups do not share the same missing data pattern.

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: The 59 study sites for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 819 participants 55 to 90 years of age with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and AD who were followed up during the period from 2005 to 2007. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of change in level of Abeta42 in CSF, FDG uptake, hippocampal volume, and the Alzheimer Disease's Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale score during up to 36 months of follow-up by diagnostic group as well as prediction of cognitive change by each biomarker. RESULTS: Reductions in the level of Abeta42 in CSF were numerically greater in participants with normal cognition than in participants with mild cognitive impairment or AD; whereas both glucose metabolic decline and hippocampal atrophy were significantly slower in participants with normal cognition than in participants with mild cognitive impairment or AD. Positive APOE4 status accelerated hippocampal atrophic changes in participants with mild cognitive impairment or AD, but did not modify rates of change in level of Abeta42 in CSF or FDG uptake. The Alzheimer Disease's Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale scores were related only to the baseline level of Abeta42 in CSF and the baseline FDG uptake in participants with normal cognition, which were about equally associated with change in FDG uptake and hippocampal volume in participants with mild cognitive impairment and best modeled by change in FDG uptake in participants with AD. CONCLUSION: Trajectories of Abeta42 level in CSF, FDG uptake, and hippocampal volume vary across different cognitive stages. The longitudinal patterns support a hypothetical sequence of AD pathology in which amyloid deposition is an early event before hypometabolism or hippocampal atrophy, suggesting that biomarker prediction for cognitive change is stage dependent. :: Notes: Lo, Raymond Y :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21670386 :: Author Address: Division of Epidemiology, University of California, Berkeley, 94720-3190, USA. rlo@berkeley.edu

In this study, we performed a multivariate analysis of 146 plasma analytes (the Human DiscoveryMAP v 1.0 from Rules-Based Medicine) in 527 subjects with AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or cognitively normal elderly subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. We identified 4 different proteomic signatures, each using 5 to 14 analytes, that differentiate AD from control patients with sensitivity and specificity ranging from 74% to 85%. Five analytes were common to all 4 signatures: apolipoprotein A-II, apolipoprotein E, serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, alpha-1-microglobulin, and brain natriuretic peptide. None of the signatures adequately predicted progression from MCI to AD over a 12- and 24-month period. A new panel of analytes, optimized to predict MCI to AD conversion, was able to provide 55% to 60% predictive accuracy. These data suggest that a simple panel of plasma analytes may provide an adjunctive tool to differentiate AD from controls, may provide mechanistic insights to the etiology of AD, but cannot adequately predict MCI to AD conversion. :: Notes: Llano, Daniel A :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23023094 :: Author Address: Department of Molecular and Integrative Physiology, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign 61801, USA. d-llano@uiuc.edu

However, this link between the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2718058 and the pathology of AD have not been mentioned yet. Therefore, this study assessed the strength of association between the NME8 rs2718058 genotypes and AD-related measures including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta, tau, P-tau concentrations, neuroimaging biomarkers and cognitive performance, in a large cohort from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We used information of a total of 719 individuals, including 211 normal cognition (NC), 346 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 162 AD. Although we didn't observe a positive relationship between rs2718058 and AD, it was significantly associated with several AD related endophenotypes. Among the normal cognitively normal participants, the minor allele G carriers showed significantly associated with higher CDRSB score than A allele carriers (P = 0.021). Occipital gyrus atrophy were significantly associated with NME8 genotype status (P = 0.002), with A allele carriers has more atrophy than the minor allele G carriers in AD patients; lateral ventricle (both right and left) cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) were significantly associated with NME8 genotype (P<0.05), with GA genotype had higher metabolism than GG and AA genotypes in MCI group; the atrophic right hippocampus in 18 months is significantly different between the three group, with GG and AA genotypes had more hippocampus atrophy than GA genotypes in the whole group. Together, our results are consistent with the direction of previous research, suggesting that NME8 rs2718058 appears to play a role in lowering the brain neurodegeneration. :: Notes: Liu, Ying :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25486118 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, Dalian Medical University, Qingdao Municipal Hospital, Qingdao, China.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are known to predict this conversion. We sought evidence for the differences in white matter connectivity between early amnestic MCI (EMCI) subgroups according to a CSF phosphorylated tau181p/amyloid beta1-42 ratio of 0.10. From the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, 16 high-ratio, 25 low-ratio EMCI patients, and 20 normal controls with diffusion tensor images and CSF profiles were included. Compared to the high-ratio group, radial diffusivity significantly increased in both sides of the corpus callosum and the superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus in the low-ratio group. In widespread white matter skeleton regions, the low-ratio group showed significantly increased mean, axial, and radial diffusivity compared to normal controls. However, the high-ratio group showed no differences when compared to the normal group. In conclusion, our study revealed that there were significant differences in white matter connectivity between EMCI subgroups according to CSF phosphorylated tau181p/amyloid beta1-42 ratios. © 2014 Lim et al. :: Notes: Export Date: 28 May 2014 :: URL: http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84897551235&partnerID=40&md5=b0217d619669d358d1dffcd51e8cff95 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, Seoul Metropolitan Government-Seoul National University Boramae Medical Center, Seoul, South Korea

The studied subjects were 139 persons with MCI enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Predictors of progression to AD included brain volume, ventricular volume, hippocampal volume, APOE epsilon4 two alleles, Abeta42, p-tau181, p-tau181/Abeta42, memory, language, and executive function. We employ a combination of Cox regression analyses and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methods to assess the prognostic utility and performance stability of candidate biomarkers. In a demographic-adjusted multivariable Cox model, seven measures- brain volume, hippocampal volume, ventricular volume, APOE epsilon4 two alleles, Abeta42, Memory composite, Executive function composite - predicted progression to AD. Time-dependent ROC revealed that this multivariable model had an area under the curve of 0.832, 0.788, 0.794, and 0.757 at 12, 18, 24, and 36 months respectively. Supplemental Cox models with time of origin set differentially at 12, 18, 24 and 36 months showed that six measures were significant predictors at 12 months whereas only memory and executive function predicted progression to AD at 18 and 24 months. The authors concluded that baseline volumetric MRI and cognitive measures selectively predict progression from MCI to AD, with cognitive measures remaining predictive even late in the follow-up period. These findings may inform case selection for AD clinical trials. :: Notes: Li, Shanshan :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24524014 :: Author Address: Department of Biostatistics, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.

Genetic analyses have reported numerous BD susceptibility genes, while some variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CACNA1C have been successfully replicated, many others have not and subsequently their effects on the intermediate phenotypes cannot be verified. Here, we studied the MDD-related gene CREB1 in a set of independent BD sample groups of European ancestry (a total of 64[thinsp]888 subjects) and identified multiple SNPs significantly associated with BD (the most significant being SNP rs6785[lsqb]A[rsqb], P=6.32 [times] 10-5, odds ratio (OR)=1.090). Risk SNPs were then subjected to further analyses in healthy Europeans for intermediate phenotypes of BD, including hippocampal volume, hippocampal function and cognitive performance. Our results showed that the risk SNPs were significantly associated with hippocampal volume and hippocampal function, with the risk alleles showing a decreased hippocampal volume and diminished activation of the left hippocampus, adding further evidence for their involvement in BD susceptibility. We also found the risk SNPs were strongly associated with CREB1 expression in lymphoblastoid cells (P<0.005) and the prefrontal cortex (P<1.0 [times] 10-6). Remarkably, population genetic analysis indicated that CREB1 displayed striking differences in allele frequencies between continental populations, and the risk alleles were completely absent in East Asian populations. We demonstrated that the regional prevalence of the CREB1 risk alleles in Europeans is likely caused by genetic hitchhiking due to natural selection acting on a nearby gene. Our results suggest that differential population histories due to natural selection on regional populations may lead to genetic heterogeneity of susceptibility to complex diseases, such as BD, and explain inconsistencies in detecting the genetic markers of these diseases among different ethnic populations. :: Notes: Supplementary information available for this article at http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v19/n4/suppinfo/mp201337s1.html :: URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/mp.2013.37 ::

METHODS: Using 0-, 6-, 12-, 18-, 24-, and 36-month MRI scans of controls and subjects with MCI and AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, we calculated volume change of whole brain, hippocampus, and ventricles between all pairs of scans using the boundary shift integral. RESULTS: We found no evidence of acceleration in whole-brain atrophy rates in any group. There was evidence that hippocampal atrophy rates in MCI subjects accelerate by 0.22%/year2 on average (p = 0.037). There was evidence of acceleration in rates of ventricular enlargement in subjects with MCI (p = 0.001) and AD (p < 0.001), with rates estimated to increase by 0.27 mL/year2 (95% confidence interval 0.12, 0.43) and 0.88 mL/year2 (95% confidence interval 0.47, 1.29), respectively. A post hoc analysis suggested that the acceleration of hippocampal loss in MCI subjects was mainly driven by the MCI subjects that were observed to progress to clinical AD within 3 years of baseline, with this group showing hippocampal atrophy rate acceleration of 0.50%/year2 (p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The small acceleration rates suggest a long period of transition to the pathologic losses seen in clinical AD. The acceleration in hippocampal atrophy rates in MCI subjects in the ADNI seems to be driven by those MCI subjects who concurrently progressed to a clinical diagnosis of AD. :: Notes: Leung, Kelvin K :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23303849 :: Author Address: Dementia Research Centre, UCL Institute of Neurology, Queen Square, London, UK.

Conversely, the administration of these inhibitors in clinically diagnosed subjects with AD confers little or no benefits over time. Here, we investigated the association between AD and HMGCR rs3846662, a polymorphism known to be involved in the regulation of HMGCR exon 13 skipping, in a founder population and in two distinct mixed North American populations of converting mild cognitively impaired (MCI) subjects (Alzheimer's disease Cooperative study (ADCS) and Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts). Targeting more specifically women, the G allele negative (G-) AD subjects exhibit delayed age of onset of AD (P=0.017) and significantly reduced risk of AD (OR: 0.521; P=0.0028), matching the effect size reported by the apolipoprotein E type 2 variant. Stratification for APOE4 in a large sample of MCI patients from the ADCS cohort revealed a significant protective effect of G negative carriers on AD conversion 3 years after MCI diagnosis (odds ratio (OR): 0.554; P=0.041). Conversion rate among APOE4 carriers with the HMGCR's G negative allele was markedly reduced (from 76% to 27%) to levels similar to APOE4 non-carriers (27.14%), which strongly indicate protection. Conversion data from the independent ADNI cohort also showed significantly reduced MCI or AD conversion among APOE4 carriers with the protective A allele (P=0.005). In conclusion, HMGCR rs3846662 acts as a potent genetic modifier for AD risk, age of onset and conversion.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 15 July 2014; doi:10.1038/mp.2014.81. :: Notes: Leduc, V :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25023145 :: Author Address: 1] Centre for the Studies in the Prevention of Alzheimer's disease, Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Montreal, QC, Canada [2] Department of Nutrition, Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal, Universite de Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada.

In this context, assessment of models' robustness to noise and imaging protocol differences together with post-processing and tuning strategies are key tasks to be addressed in order to move towards successful clinical applications. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of Random Forest classifiers trained using different structural MRI measures, with and without neuroanatomical constraints in the detection and prediction of AD in terms of accuracy and between-cohort robustness. From The ADNI database, 185 AD, and 225 healthy controls (HC) were randomly split into training and testing datasets. 165 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) were distributed according to the month of conversion to dementia (4-year follow-up). Structural 1.5-T MRI-scans were processed using Freesurfer segmentation and cortical reconstruction. Using the resulting output, AD/HC classifiers were trained. Training included model tuning and performance assessment using out-of-bag estimation. Subsequently the classifiers were validated on the AD/HC test set and for the ability to predict MCI-to-AD conversion. Models' between-cohort robustness was additionally assessed using the AddNeuroMed dataset acquired with harmonized clinical and imaging protocols. In the ADNI set, the best AD/HC sensitivity/specificity (88.6%/92.0% - test set) was achieved by combining cortical thickness and volumetric measures. The Random Forest model resulted in significantly higher accuracy compared to the reference classifier (linear Support Vector Machine). The models trained using parcelled and high-dimensional (HD) input demonstrated equivalent performance, but the former was more effective in terms of computation/memory and time costs. The sensitivity/specificity for detecting MCI-to-AD conversion (but not AD/HC classification performance) was further improved from 79.5%/75%-83.3%/81.3% by a combination of morphometric measurements with ApoE-genotype and demographics (age, sex, education). When applied to the independent AddNeuroMed cohort, the best ADNI models produced equivalent performance without substantial accuracy drop, suggesting good robustness sufficient for future clinical implementation. :: Notes: Lebedev, A V :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25379423 :: Author Address: Centre for Age-Related Medicine, Stavanger University Hospital, Stavanger, Norway.

Whether this effect is secondary to the association of the APOE epsilon4 allele with cortical Abeta deposition or whether APOE epsilon4 directly influences CSF levels of Abeta42 independently of Abeta pathology remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether the APOE genotype affects the diagnostic accuracy of CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer disease (AD), in particular Abeta42 levels, and whether the association of APOE epsilon4 with CSF biomarkers depends on cortical Abeta status. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We collected data from 4 different centers in Sweden, Finland, and Germany. Cohort A consisted of 1345 individuals aged 23 to 99 years with baseline CSF samples, including 309 with AD, 287 with prodromal AD, 399 with stable mild cognitive impairment, 99 with dementias other than AD, and 251 controls. Cohort B included 105 nondemented younger individuals (aged 20-34 years) with CSF samples available. Cohort C included 118 patients aged 60 to 80 years with mild cognitive symptoms who underwent flutemetamol F 18 ([18F]flumetamol) positron emission tomography amyloid imaging and CSF tap. EXPOSURES: Standard care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cerebrospinal fluid levels of Abeta42 and total and phosphorylated tau in relation to the APOE epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 polymorphism in different diagnostic groups and in cases with or without cortical uptake of [18F]flutemetamol. RESULTS: The CSF levels of Abeta42 but not total and phosphorylated tau were lower in APOE epsilon4 carriers compared with noncarriers irrespective of diagnostic group (cohort A). Despite this, CSF levels of Abeta42 differed between participants with AD when compared with controls and those with stable mild cognitive impairment, even when stratifying for APOE genotype (P < .001 to P = .006). Multiple binary logistic regression revealed that CSF levels of Abeta42 and APOE epsilon4 genotype were independent predictors of AD diagnosis. In cohort B, APOE epsilon4 carrier status did not influence CSF levels of Abeta42. Moreover, when stratifying for cortical uptake of [18F]flutemetamol in cohort C, APOE epsilon4 genotype did not influence CSF levels of Abeta42. This result was replicated in a cohort with individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using carbon 11-labeled Pittsburgh Compound B scanning. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cerebrospinal fluid levels of Abeta42 are strongly associated with the diagnosis of AD and cortical Abeta accumulation independent of APOE genotype. The clinical cutoff for CSF levels of Abeta42 should be the same for all APOE genotypes. :: Notes: Lautner, Ronald :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25162367 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Sahlgrenska Academy, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg and Molndal, Sweden.

The AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is acquiring FDG PET, volumetric magnetic resonance imaging, and other biomarker measurements in a large longitudinal multi-center study of initially mildly affected probable AD (pAD) patients, amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients, who are at increased AD risk, and cognitively normal controls (NC), and we are responsible for analyzing the PET images using statistical parametric mapping (SPM). Here we compare baseline CMRgl measurements from 74 pAD patients and 142 aMCI patients to those from 82 NC, we correlate CMRgl with categorical and continuous measures of clinical disease severity, and we compare apolipoprotein E (APOE) varepsilon4 carriers to non-carriers in each of these subject groups. In comparison with NC, the pAD and aMCI groups each had significantly lower CMRgl bilaterally in posterior cingulate, precuneus, parietotemporal and frontal cortex. Similar reductions were observed when categories of disease severity or lower Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores were correlated with lower CMRgl. However, when analyses were restricted to the pAD patients, lower MMSE scores were significantly correlated with lower left frontal and temporal CMRgl. These findings from a large, multi-site study support previous single-site findings, supports the characteristic pattern of baseline CMRgl reductions in AD and aMCI patients, as well as preferential anterior CMRgl reductions after the onset of AD dementia. :: Notes: Langbaum, Jessica B S :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19349228 :: Author Address: Banner Alzheimer's Institute and Banner Good Samaritan PET Center, Phoenix, AZ, USA.

METHODS: APOE epsilon4 allele frequency, CSF proteins (Abeta(1-42), total tau, hyperphosphorylated tau [p-tau(181p)]), glucose metabolism (FDG-PET), hippocampal volume, and episodic memory performance were evaluated at baseline in patients with amnestic MCI (n = 85), using data from a large multisite study (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative). Patients were classified as normal or abnormal on each predictor variable based on externally derived cutoffs, and then variables were evaluated as predictors of subsequent conversion to Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitive decline (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale) during a variable follow-up period (1.9 +/- 0.4 years). RESULTS: Patients with MCI converted to AD at an annual rate of 17.2%. Subjects with MCI who had abnormal results on both FDG-PET and episodic memory were 11.7 times more likely to convert to AD than subjects who had normal results on both measures (p <or= 0.02). In addition, the CSF ratio p-tau(181p)/Abeta(1-42) (beta = 1.10 +/- 0.53; p = 0.04) and, marginally, FDG-PET predicted cognitive decline. CONCLUSIONS: Baseline FDG-PET and episodic memory predict conversion to AD, whereas p-tau(181p)/Abeta(1-42) and, marginally, FDG-PET predict longitudinal cognitive decline. Complementary information provided by these biomarkers may aid in future selection of patients for clinical trials or identification of patients likely to benefit from a therapeutic intervention. :: Notes: Landau, S M :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20592257 :: Author Address: Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California, Berkeley 94720-3190, USA. slandau@berkeley.edu

Clinical :: ISSN: 2213-1582 (Electronic) :: PMCID: 4215425 :: Accession Number: 25379448 :: Abstract: A positive family history (FH) raises the risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease though, other than the known risk conferred by apolipoprotein epsilon4 (ApoE4), much of the genetic variance remains unexplained. We examined the effect of family history on longitudinal regional brain atrophy rates in 184 subjects (42% FH+, mean age 79.9) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) enrolled in a national biomarker study. An automated image analysis method was applied to T1-weighted MR images to measure atrophy rates for 20 cortical and subcortical regions. Mixed-effects linear regression models incorporating repeated-measures to control for within-subject variation over multiple time points tested the effect of FH over a follow-up of up to 48 months. Most of the 20 regions showed significant atrophy over time. Adjusting for age and gender, subjects with a positive FH had greater atrophy of the amygdala (p < 0.01), entorhinal cortex (p < 0.01), hippocampus (p < 0.053) and cortical gray matter (p < 0.009). However, when E4 genotype was added as a covariate, none of the FH effects remained significant. Analyses by ApoE genotype showed that the effect of FH on amygdala atrophy rates was numerically greater in epsilon3 homozygotes than in E4 carriers, but this difference was not significant. FH+ subjects had numerically greater 4-year cognitive decline and conversion rates than FH- subjects but the difference was not statistically significant after adjusting for ApoE and other variables. We conclude that a positive family history of AD may influence cortical and temporal lobe atrophy in subjects with mild cognitive impairment, but it does not have a significant additional effect beyond the known effect of the E4 genotype. :: Notes: Lampert, Erika J :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25379448 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, NC, USA.

Our aim was to examine the effects of FH on pathological and neuronal loss biomarkers across the cognitive spectrum. DESIGN: Cross-sectional analyses of data from a national biomarker study. SETTING: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative national study. PATIENTS: 257 subjects (ages 55-89), divided into cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD groups, with CSF and FH data. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42, tau, and tau/Abeta42 ratio, MRI-measured hippocampal volumes. STATISTICS: Univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: In MCI, CSF Abeta42 was lower (p = .005), t-tau was higher (p = 0.02) and t-tau/Abeta42 ratio was higher (p = 0.002) in FH+ than FH- subjects. A significant residual effect of FH on pathologic markers in MCI remained after adjusting for ApoE4 (p<0.05). Among CN, 47% of FH+ exhibited "pathologic signature of AD" (CSF t-tau/Abeta42 ratio >0.39) versus 21% of FH- controls (p = 0.03). The FH effect was not significant in AD subjects. Hippocampal and intracranial volumes did not differ between FH+ and FH- subjects in any group. CONCLUSIONS: A positive family history of late-onset AD is associated with a higher prevalence of an abnormal cerebral beta-amyloid and tau protein phenotype in MCI. The unexplained genetic heritability in family history is about the half the size of the ApoE4 effect. Longitudinal studies are warranted to more definitively examine this issue. :: Notes: Lampert, Erika J :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23613741 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry, Duke University Medical Center, Durham, North Carolina, United States of America.

In stage 1, we used genotyped and imputed data (7,055,881 SNPs) to perform meta-analysis on 4 previously published GWAS data sets consisting of 17,008 Alzheimer's disease cases and 37,154 controls.

Increasing evidence suggests that compromised mitochondrial function contributes to the aging process and thus may increase the risk of AD. Dysfunctional mitochondria contribute to reactive oxygen species (ROS) which can lead to extensive macromolecule oxidative damage and the progression of amyloid pathology. Oxidative stress and amyloid toxicity leave neurons chemically vulnerable. Because the brain relies on aerobic metabolism, it is apparent that mitochondria are critical for the cerebral function. Mitochondrial DNA sequence changes could shift cell dynamics and facilitate neuronal vulnerability. Therefore we postulated that mitochondrial DNA sequence polymorphisms may increase the risk of AD. We evaluated the role of mitochondrial haplogroups derived from 138 mitochondrial polymorphisms in 358 Caucasian Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects. Our results indicate that the mitochondrial haplogroup UK may confer genetic susceptibility to AD independently of the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele. :: Notes: Lakatos, Anita :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20538375 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry and Human Behavior, University of California, Irvine, CA 92617, USA. alakatos@uci.edu

We investigate the potential of alpha-synuclein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a biomarker of cognitive decline in AD, and its prodromal phase, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Using an established, sensitive Luminex assay, we measured alpha-synuclein levels in the CSF of a cohort of close to 400 healthy control, MCI, and AD subjects obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and factored in APOE genotype in data analysis. CSF alpha-synuclein levels were significantly higher in the MCI (p = 0.005) and AD (p < 0.001) groups, compared to controls. However, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis suggests that CSF alpha-synuclein level on its own only offered modest sensitivity (65%) and specificity (74%) as a diagnostic marker of AD, with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.719 for AD versus controls. The effect of APOE genotype, if any, was quite subtle. However, there was a significant correlation between alpha-synuclein and cognition (p = 0.001), with increased alpha-synuclein levels associated with decreased Mini-Mental State Exam scores. Our results support a role for alpha-synuclein even in MCI, the early phase of AD, in addition to being a potential contributor in MCI and AD diagnosis or monitoring of disease progression. :: Notes: Korff, Ane :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23603399 :: Author Address: Department of Pathology, University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA 98104, USA.

Subsets of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts were used for discovery and for two independent validation analyses. A significant interaction between RYR3 and CACNA1C was confirmed in all three of the independent ADNI datasets. Both genes encode calcium channels expressed in the brain. The results shown here support previous animal studies implicating interactions between these calcium channels in amyloidogenesis and suggest that the pathological cascade of this disease may be modified by interactions in the amyloid-calcium axis. Future work focusing on the mechanisms of such relationships may inform targets for clinical intervention. :: Notes: Koran, Mary Ellen I :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24026422 :: Author Address: Medical Scientist Training Program, Center for Human Genetics and Research, Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, 37232, USA, maryellen.koran@gmail.com.

Recent genome wide association studies in LOAD have led to the discovery of novel genetic risk factors; however, the investigation of gene-gene interactions has been limited. Conventional genetic studies often use binary disease status as the primary phenotype, but for complex brain-based diseases, neuroimaging data can serve as quantitative endophenotypes that correlate with disease status and closely reflect pathological changes. In the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort, we tested for association of genetic interactions with longitudinal MRI measurements of the inferior lateral ventricles (ILVs), which have repeatedly shown a relationship to LOAD status and progression. We performed linear regression to evaluate the ability of pathway-derived SNP-SNP pairs to predict the slope of change in volume of the ILVs. After Bonferroni correction, we identified four significant interactions in the right ILV (RILV) corresponding to gene-gene pairs SYNJ2-PI4KA, PARD3-MYH2, PDE3A-ABHD12B, and OR2L13-PRKG1 and one significant interaction in the left ILV (LILV) corresponding to SYNJ2-PI4KA. The SNP-SNP interaction corresponding to SYNJ2-PI4KA was identical in the RILV and LILV and was the most significant interaction in each (RILV: p = 9.13 x 10(-12); LILV: p = 8.17 x 10(-13)). Both genes belong to the inositol phosphate signaling pathway which has been previously associated with neurodegeneration in AD and we discuss the possibility that perturbation of this pathway results in a down-regulation of the Akt cell survival pathway and, thereby, decreased neuronal survival, as reflected by increased volume of the ventricles. :: Notes: Koran, Mary Ellen I :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24077433 :: Author Address: Center for Human Genetics and Research, Department of Molecular Physiology & Biophysics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA Medical Scientist Training Program, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.

Impaired frontal lobe function has been previously implicated in AD+P. The current exploratory study, presented in two parts, evaluates both the regional brain metabolic and psychometric correlates of psychosis in a longitudinal sample of subjects with AD, made available by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). METHODS: In Part 1 of the study, 21 ADNI participants with AD who developed psychotic symptoms during the study but were not psychotic at baseline were matched with 21 participants with AD who never became psychotic during the study period, and mean brain [F(18)]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) Cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) by regions of interest (ROIs) were compared Additionally, 39 participants with active psychosis at the time of image acquisition were matched with 39 participants who were never psychotic during the study period, and mean brain FDG-PET CMRgl by sROI were compared. In Part 2 of the study, 354 ADNI participants with AD who were followed for 24 months with serial psychometric testing were identified, and cognitive performance and decline were evaluated for correlation with psychotic symptoms. RESULTS: Part 1: There were no regional brain metabolic differences between those with AD destined to become psychotic and those who did not become psychotic. There was a significant reduction in mean orbitofrontal brain metabolism in those with active psychosis. Part 2: Over the course of study follow-up, psychosis was associated with accelerated decline in functional performance as measured by the Functional Assessment Questionnaire, the Mini-Mental State Examination, and Forward Digit Span. CONCLUSION: In a sample drawn from the ADNI dataset, our exploratory FDG-PET findings and longitudinal cognitive outcomes support the hypofrontality model of AD+P. Focal frontal vulnerability may mediate the accelerated decline seen in AD+P. :: Notes: Koppel, Jeremy :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23672944 :: Author Address: Litwin Zucker Alzheimer's Research Center, Manhasset, NY.

Genetic pre-selection, however, has been limited to Apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Recently discovered polymorphisms in the CLU, CR1 and PICALM genes are also moderate risk factors for AD; each affects lifetime AD risk by ~ 10-20%. Here, we tested the hypothesis that pre-selecting subjects based on these variants along with ApoE genotype would further boost clinical trial power, relative to considering ApoE alone, using an MRI-derived 2-year atrophy rate as our outcome measure. We ranked subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) based on their cumulative risk from these four genes. We obtained sample size estimates in cohorts enriched in subjects with greater aggregate genetic risk. Enriching for additional genetic biomarkers reduced the required sample sizes by up to 50%, for MCI trials. Thus, AD drug trial enrichment with multiple genotypes may have potential implications for the timeliness, cost, and power of trials. :: Notes: Kohannim, Omid :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24179834 :: Author Address: Imaging Genetics Center, Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Dept. of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

We introduce a machine learning method to boost power in clinical trials. We created a Support Vector Machine algorithm that combines brain imaging and other biomarkers to classify 737 Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) subjects as having Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or normal controls. We trained our classifiers based on example data including: MRI measures of hippocampal, ventricular, and temporal lobe volumes, a PET-FDG numerical summary, CSF biomarkers (t-tau, p-tau, and Abeta(42)), ApoE genotype, age, sex, and body mass index. MRI measures contributed most to Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification; PET-FDG and CSF biomarkers, particularly Abeta(42), contributed more to MCI classification. Using all biomarkers jointly, we used our classifier to select the one-third of the subjects most likely to decline. In this subsample, fewer than 40 AD and MCI subjects would be needed to detect a 25% slowing in temporal lobe atrophy rates with 80% power--a substantial boosting of power relative to standard imaging measures. :: Notes: Kohannim, Omid :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20541286 :: Author Address: Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Department of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1769, USA.

We developed a new approach, based on ridge regression, to jointly evaluate multiple, correlated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of brain images. Our goal was to boost the power to detect gene effects on brain images. We tested our method on MRI-derived hippocampal and temporal lobe volume measures, from 740 subjects scanned by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We identified two significant and one almost significant SNP for the hippocampal and temporal lobe volume phenotypes, respectively, after correcting for multiple statistical tests across the genome. Ridge regression gave more significant associations than univariate analysis. Two SNPs, near regulatory genomic regions, showed significant voxelwise effects in post hoc, tensor-based morphometry analyses. Genome-wide ridge regression may detect SNPs missed by univariate GWAS, by incorporating multi-SNP dependencies in the model. ::  ::  ::

These SNPs were considered jointly when assessing their association with neuroimaging measures. We discovered 22 genes that passed genome-wide significance for influencing temporal lobe volume. This was a substantially greater number of significant genes compared to those found with standard, univariate GWAS. These top genes are all expressed in the brain and include genes previously related to brain function or neuropsychiatric disorders such as MACROD2, SORCS2, GRIN2B, MAGI2, NPAS3, CLSTN2, GABRG3, NRXN3, PRKAG2, GAS7, RBFOX1, ADARB2, CHD4, and CDH13. The top genes we identified with this method also displayed significant and widespread post hoc effects on voxelwise, tensor-based morphometry (TBM) maps of the temporal lobes. The most significantly associated gene was an autism susceptibility gene known as MACROD2. We were able to successfully replicate the effect of the MACROD2 gene in an independent cohort of 564 young, Australian healthy adult twins and siblings scanned with MRI (mean age: 23.8 +/- 2.2 SD years). Our approach powerfully complements univariate techniques in detecting influences of genes on the living brain. :: Notes: Kohannim, Omid :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22888310 :: Author Address: Imaging Genetics Center at the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Department of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine Los Angeles, CA, USA.

We applied a multivariate approach, based on L(1)-L(2)-regularized regression (elastic net) to predict a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) tensor-based morphometry-derived measure of temporal lobe volume from a genome-wide scan in 740 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) subjects. We tuned the elastic net model's parameters using internal crossvalidation and evaluated the model on independent test sets. Compared to 100,000 permutations performed with randomized imaging measures, the predictions were found to be statistically significant (p ~ 0.001). The rs9933137 variant in the RBFOX1 gene was a highly contributory genotype, along with rs10845840 in GRIN2B and rs2456930, discovered previously in a univariate genomewide search. :: Notes: Kohannim, Omid :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22903144 :: Author Address: Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Dept. of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

The influence of genetic variation on these markers has been investigated for candidate genes but not on a genome-wide basis. We report a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of CSF biomarkers (Abeta1-42, t-tau, p-tau181p, p-tau181p/Abeta1-42, and t-tau/Abeta1-42). METHODS: A total of 374 non-Hispanic Caucasian participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort with quality-controlled CSF and genotype data were included in this analysis. The main effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) under an additive genetic model was assessed on each of 5 CSF biomarkers. The p values of all SNPs for each CSF biomarker were adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni method. We focused on SNPs with corrected p<0.01 (uncorrected p<3.10x10(-8)) and secondarily examined SNPs with uncorrected p values less than 10(-5) to identify potential candidates. RESULTS: Four SNPs in the regions of the APOE, LOC100129500, TOMM40, and EPC2 genes reached genome-wide significance for associations with one or more CSF biomarkers. SNPs in CCDC134, ABCG2, SREBF2, and NFATC4, although not reaching genome-wide significance, were identified as potential candidates. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to known candidate genes, APOE, TOMM40, and one hypothetical gene LOC100129500 partially overlapping APOE; one novel gene, EPC2, and several other interesting genes were associated with CSF biomarkers that are related to AD. These findings, especially the new EPC2 results, require replication in independent cohorts. :: Notes: Kim, S :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21123754 :: Author Address: Center for Neuroimaging, Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Indiana University School of Medicine, 950 West Walnut Street, R2 E124, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA.

Genetic variation may modulate corresponding protein levels and point to the role of these variants in disease pathophysiology. Effects of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a gene were analyzed for corresponding plasma protein levels using genome-wide association study (GWAS) genotype data and proteomic panel data with 132 quality-controlled analytes from 521 Caucasian participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Linear regression analysis detected 112 significant (Bonferroni threshold p=2.44x10(-5)) associations between 27 analytes and 112 SNPs. 107 out of these 112 associations were tested in the Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) cohort for replication and 50 associations were replicated at uncorrected p<0.05 in the same direction of effect as those in the ADNI. We identified multiple novel associations including the association of rs7517126 with plasma complement factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR1) level at p<1.46x10(-60), accounting for 40 percent of total variation of the protein level. We serendipitously found the association of rs6677604 with the same protein at p<9.29x10(-112). Although these two SNPs were not in the strong linkage disequilibrium, 61 percent of total variation of CFHR1 was accounted for by rs6677604 without additional variation by rs7517126 when both SNPs were tested together. 78 other SNP-protein associations in the ADNI sample exceeded genome-wide significance (5x10(-8)). Our results confirmed previously identified gene-protein associations for interleukin-6 receptor, chemokine CC-4, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and angiotensinogen, although the direction of effect was reversed in some cases. This study is among the first analyses of gene-protein product relationships integrating multiplex-panel proteomics and targeted genes extracted from a GWAS array. With intensive searches taking place for proteomic biomarkers for many diseases, the role of genetic variation takes on new importance and should be considered in interpretation of proteomic results. :: Notes: Kim, Sungeun :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23894628 :: Author Address: Center for Neuroimaging, Department of Radiology and Imaging Sciences, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA.

However, the known risk genes excluding APOE are not clinically useful. In various complex diseases, gene studies have targeted rare alleles for unsolved heritability. Our study aims to elucidate previously unknown risk genes for AD by targeting rare alleles. We used data from five publicly available genetic studies from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP). A total of 4,171 cases and 9,358 controls were included. The genotype information of rare alleles was imputed using 1,000 genomes. We performed gene-based analysis of rare alleles (minor allele frequency</=3%). The genome-wide significance level was defined as meta P<1.8x10-6 (0.05/number of genes in human genome = 0.05/28,517). ZNF628, which is located at chromosome 19q13.42, showed a genome-wide significant association with AD. The association of ZNF628 with AD was not dependent on APOE epsilon4. APOE and TREM2 were also significantly associated with AD, although not at genome-wide significance levels. Other genes identified by targeting common alleles could not be replicated in our gene-based rare allele analysis. We identified that rare variants in ZNF628 are associated with AD. The protein encoded by ZNF628 is known as a transcription factor. Furthermore, the associations of APOE and TREM2 with AD were highly significant, even in gene-based rare allele analysis, which implies that further deep sequencing of these genes is required in AD heritability studies. :: Notes: Kim, Jong Hun :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25329708 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, Dementia Center, Stroke Center, Ilsan hospital, National Health Insurance Service, Goyang-shi, South Korea.

There is thus a need for inexpensive and non-invasive screening methods that are able to accurately estimate brain amyloid burden as a marker of Alzheimer's disease. One potential method would involve using demographic information and measurements on plasma samples to establish biomarkers of brain amyloid burden; in this study data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative was used to explore this possibility. Sixteen of the analytes on the Rules Based Medicine Human Discovery Multi-Analyte Profile 1.0 panel were found to associate with [(11)C]-PiB PET measurements. Some of these markers of brain amyloid burden were also found to associate with other AD related phenotypes. Thirteen of these markers of brain amyloid burden--c-peptide, fibrinogen, alpha-1-antitrypsin, pancreatic polypeptide, complement C3, vitronectin, cortisol, AXL receptor kinase, interleukin-3, interleukin-13, matrix metalloproteinase-9 total, apolipoprotein E and immunoglobulin E--were used along with co-variates in multiple linear regression, and were shown by cross-validation to explain >30% of the variance of brain amyloid burden. When a threshold was used to classify subjects as PiB positive, the regression model was found to predict actual PiB positive individuals with a sensitivity of 0.918 and a specificity of 0.545. The number of APOE [Symbol: see text] 4 alleles and plasma apolipoprotein E level were found to contribute most to this model, and the relationship between these variables and brain amyloid burden was explored. :: Notes: Kiddle, Steven John :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23028511 :: Author Address: National Institute of Health Research Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health, South London and Maudsley National Health Service Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom. steven.kiddle@kcl.ac.uk

Markers identified so far are likely to account for only a tiny fraction of the heritability of AD and many more genetic risk alleles are thought to be undiscovered. Objective: Identifying genetic markers for AD using combined analysis of genetics and brain imaging data. Methods: Imaging quantitative trait loci (iQTLs) has recently emerged as an interesting research area for linking genetics of brain changes to AD. We consider a genome-wide association scan of 109 brain-wide regional imaging phenotypes to identify genetic susceptibility loci for AD from a combined set of 1,045 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the AddNeuroMed studies. We use one-SNP-at-a-time as well as multi-SNP Hyperlasso based iQTL methods for the analysis. Results: We identified several novel markers associated with AD, namely HOMER2 (rs1256429; intronic, p = 8.7 x 10-10), EOMES (rs2724509; flanking), JAM2 (rs2829841; intronic), and WEE1 (rs10770042; coding). The SNP rs1256429 (HOMER2) was one of the top hits in Hyperlasso as well as in the single-SNP analysis showing an association with the volume of the right thalamus and AD, a brain region reported to be linked with AD in several studies. Conclusion: We believe that the markers identified in this study are novel additions to the existing list of genetic variants associated with AD which can be validated in future replicated studies. :: Notes: Khondoker, Mizanur :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25649652 :: Author Address: King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, London and NIHR Biomedical Research Centre for Mental Health, London, United Kingdom King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Department of Biostatistics, London, United Kingdom.

This study used an automated analysis technique and two large cohorts to (1) investigate patterns of subfield volume loss in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, (2) determine the pattern of subfield volume loss due to age, gender, education, APOE epsilon4 genotype, and neuropsychological test scores, (3) compare combined subfield volumes to hippocampal volume alone at discriminating between AD and healthy controls (HC), and predicting future MCI conversion to AD at 12 months. 1,069 subjects were selected from the AddNeuroMed and Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) cohorts. Freesurfer was used for automated segmentation of the hippocampus and hippocampal subfields. Orthogonal partial least squares to latent structures (OPLS) was used to train models on AD and HC subjects using one cohort for training and the other for testing and the combined cohort was used to predict MCI conversion. MANCOVA and linear regression analyses showed multiple subfield volumes including Cornu Ammonis 1 (CA1), subiculum and presubiculum were atrophied in AD and MCI and were related to age, gender, education, APOE epsilon4 genotype, and neuropsychological test scores. For classifying AD from HC, combined subfield volumes achieved comparable classification accuracy (81.7 %) to total hippocampal (80.7 %), subiculum (81.2 %) and presubiculum (80.6 %) volume.

Methods: We tested this recommendation with clinical trial simulations using participants from a meta-database of 19 studies to create trial samples with APOE ε4 proportions ranging from 0% (all noncarriers) to 100% (all carriers). For each percentage of APOE ε4 carriers, we resampled the database randomly for 1000 trials for each trial scenario, planning for 18- or 24-month trials with samples from 50 to 400 patients per treatment or placebo group, up to 40% dropouts, and outcomes on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale, cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) with effect sizes from 0.15 to 0.75, and calculated statistical power. Results: Enrichment of clinical trial participants based on APOE ε4 carrier status resulted in minimal increases in power compared with enrolling participants with the APOE ε3 genotype only or enrolling patients without regard to APOE genotype. Increased screening requirements to enhance the sample would offset gains in power. Conclusions: Although samples enriched for APOE ε4 carriers in AD or MCI clinical trials showed slightly more cognitive impairment and greater decline using the number APOE ε4 alleles as an inclusion criterion most likely would not result in more efficient trials, and trials would take longer because fewer patients would be available. The APOE ε4/εX (where X = 2, 3 or 4) genotype could be useful, however, as an explanatory variable or covariate if warranted by a drug's action. © 2014 The Alzheimer's Association.

We implemented a functional fine-mapping approach, leveraging intermediate phenotypes to identify functional variant(s) within the CR1 locus. Using 1709 subjects (697 deceased) from the Religious Orders Study and the Rush Memory and Aging Project, we tested 41 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the linkage disequilibrium block containing the published CR1 AD SNP (rs6656401) for associations with episodic memory decline, and then examined the functional consequences of the top result. We report that a coding variant in the LHR-D (long homologous repeat D) region of the CR1 gene, rs4844609 (Ser1610Thr, minor allele frequency = 0.02), is associated with episodic memory decline and accounts for the known effect of the index SNP rs6656401 (D' = 1, r(2)= 0.084) on this trait. Further, we demonstrate that the coding variant's effect is largely dependent on an interaction with APOE-epsilon4 and mediated by an increased burden of AD-related neuropathology. Finally, in our data, this coding variant is also associated with AD susceptibility (joint odds ratio = 1.4). Taken together, our analyses identify a CR1 coding variant that influences episodic memory decline; it is a variant known to alter the conformation of CR1 and points to LHR-D as the functional domain within the CR1 protein that mediates the effect on memory decline. We thus implicate C1q and MBL, which bind to LHR-D, as likely targets of the variant's effect and suggest that CR1 may be an important intermediate in the clearance of Abeta42 particles by C1q. :: Notes: Keenan, Brendan T :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22343410 :: Author Address: Program in Translational NeuroPsychiatric Genomics, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA

We have thoroughly sampled common variation in these genes, genotyping 355 variants in over 600 individuals for whom measurements of two AD biomarkers, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 42 amino acid amyloid beta fragments (Abeta(42)) and tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau(181)), have been obtained. Association analyses were performed to determine whether variants in BIN1, CLU, CR1 or PICALM are associated with changes in the CSF levels of these biomarkers. Despite adequate power to detect effects as small as a 1.05 fold difference, we have failed to detect evidence for association between SNPs in these genes and CSF Abeta(42) or ptau(181) levels in our sample.

The mechanisms by which these genes might modulate risk are not definitively known. CALHM1 and SORL1 may alter amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels and GAB2 may influence phosphorylation of the tau protein. In this study we have analyzed disease associated genetic variants in each of these genes for association with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta or tau levels in 602 samples from two independent CSF series. We failed to detect association between CSF Abeta42 levels and single nucleotide polymorphisms in SORL1 despite substantial statistical power to detect association. While we also failed to detect association between variants in GAB2 and CSF tau levels, power to detect this association was limited. Finally, our data suggest that the minor allele of rs2986017, in CALHM1, is marginally associated with CSF Abeta42 levels. This association is consistent with previous reports that this non-synonymous coding substitution results in increased Abeta levels in vitro and provides support for an Abeta-related mechanism for modulating risk for Alzheimer's disease. :: Notes: Kauwe, John S K :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20634593 :: Author Address: Department of Biology, Brigham Young University, Provo, UT, USA.

Citing evidence that iron may play a role in AD pathology, Robson et al. [Robson et al. (2004); J Med Genet 41:261-265] reported that epistatic interaction between rs1049296 (P589S) in the transferrin gene (TF) and rs1800562 (C282Y) in the hemochromatosis gene (HFE) results in significant association with risk for AD. In this study we attempted to replicate their findings in a total of 1,166 cases and 1,404 controls from three European and European American populations. Allele and genotype frequencies were consistent across the three populations. Using synergy factor analysis (SFA) and Logistic Regression analysis we tested each population and the combined sample for interactions between these two SNPs and risk for AD. We observed significant association between bi-carriers of the minor alleles of rs1049296 and rs1800562 in the combined sample using SFA (P = 0.0016, synergy factor = 2.71) and adjusted SFA adjusting for age and presence of the APOE epsilon 4 allele (P = 0.002, OR = 2.4). These results validate those of the previous report and support the hypothesis that iron transport and regulation play a role in AD pathology. :: Notes: Kauwe, J S K :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20029940 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry & Neurology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri 63110, USA.

Additional CSF analytes may also serve as useful endophenotypes that capture other aspects of AD pathophysiology. Here we have conducted a genome-wide association study of CSF levels of 59 AD-related analytes. All analytes were measured using the Rules Based Medicine Human DiscoveryMAP Panel, which includes analytes relevant to several disease-related processes. Data from two independently collected and measured datasets, the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), were analyzed separately, and combined results were obtained using meta-analysis. We identified genetic associations with CSF levels of 5 proteins (Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 4 (CCL4), Interleukin 6 receptor (IL6R) and Matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3)) with study-wide significant p-values (p<1.46x10-10) and significant, consistent evidence for association in both the Knight ADRC and the ADNI samples. These proteins are involved in amyloid processing and pro-inflammatory signaling. SNPs associated with ACE, IL6R and MMP3 protein levels are located within the coding regions of the corresponding structural gene. The SNPs associated with CSF levels of CCL4 and CCL2 are located in known chemokine binding proteins. The genetic associations reported here are novel and suggest mechanisms for genetic control of CSF and plasma levels of these disease-related proteins. Significant SNPs in ACE and MMP3 also showed association with AD risk. Our findings suggest that these proteins/pathways may be valuable therapeutic targets for AD. Robust associations in cognitively normal individuals suggest that these SNPs also influence regulation of these proteins more generally and may therefore be relevant to other diseases. :: Notes: Kauwe, John S K :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25340798 :: Author Address: Department of Biology, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, United States of America.

METHODS: Subjects were cognitively normal (n = 171), early-mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (n = 240), late-MCI (n = 111), and AD (n = 40) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Microhemorrhages and superficial siderosis were assessed at baseline and on all available MRIs at 3, 6, and 12 months. beta-amyloid load was assessed with (18)F-florbetapir positron emission tomography. RESULTS: Prevalence of superficial siderosis was 1% and prevalence of microhemorrhages was 25% increasing with age (P < .001) and beta-amyloid load (P < .001). Topographic densities of microhemorrhages were highest in the occipital lobes and lowest in the deep/infratentorial regions. A greater number of microhemorrhages at baseline was associated with a greater annualized rate of additional microhemorrhages by last follow-up (rank correlation = 0.49; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Focal hemosiderin deposits are relatively common in the ADNI cohort and are associated with beta-amyloid load. :: Notes: Kantarci, Kejal :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23375568 :: Author Address: Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.

However, the genetic effect attributable to known loci is about 50%, indicating that additional risk genes for LOAD remain to be identified. In this study, we have used a new GWAS data set from the University of Pittsburgh (1291 cases and 938 controls) to examine in detail the recently implicated nine new regions with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, and also performed a meta-analysis utilizing the top 1% GWAS single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with P<0.01 along with four independent data sets (2727 cases and 3336 controls) for these SNPs in an effort to identify new AD loci. The new GWAS data were generated on the Illumina Omni1-Quad chip and imputed at ~2.5 million markers. As expected, several markers in the APOE regions showed genome-wide significant associations in the Pittsburg sample. While we observed nominal significant associations (P<0.05) either within or adjacent to five genes (PICALM, BIN1, ABCA7, MS4A4/MS4A6E and EPHA1), significant signals were observed 69-180 kb outside of the remaining four genes (CD33, CLU, CD2AP and CR1). Meta-analysis on the top 1% SNPs revealed a suggestive novel association in the PPP1R3B gene (top SNP rs3848140 with P = 3.05E-07). The association of this SNP with AD risk was consistent in all five samples with a meta-analysis odds ratio of 2.43. This is a potential candidate gene for AD as this is expressed in the brain and is involved in lipid metabolism. These findings need to be confirmed in additional samples. :: Notes: Kamboh, M I :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22832961 :: Author Address: Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USA.

In addition to the disease risk, age-at-onset (AAO) of AD has also strong genetic component with an estimated heritability of 42%. Identification of AAO genes may help to understand the biological mechanisms that regulate the onset of the disease. Here we report the first GWAS focused on identifying genes for the AAO of AD. We performed a genome-wide meta-analysis on three samples comprising a total of 2222 AD cases. A total of ~2.5 million directly genotyped or imputed single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were analyzed in relation to AAO of AD. As expected, the most significant associations were observed in the apolipoprotein E (APOE) region on chromosome 19 where several SNPs surpassed the conservative genome-wide significant threshold (P<5E-08). The most significant SNP outside the APOE region was located in the DCHS2 gene on chromosome 4q31.3 (rs1466662; P=4.95E-07). There were 19 additional significant SNPs in this region at P<1E-04 and the DCHS2 gene is expressed in the cerebral cortex and thus is a potential candidate for affecting AAO in AD. These findings need to be confirmed in additional well-powered samples. :: Notes: Kamboh, M I :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22005931 :: Author Address: Department of Human Genetics, Graduate School of Public Health, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15261, USA. kamboh@pitt.edu

DESIGN: Association study of AD and CLU, PICALM, CR1, and APOE genotypes. SETTING: Academic research institutions in the United States, Canada, and Israel. PARTICIPANTS: Seven thousand seventy cases with AD, 3055 with autopsies, and 8169 elderly cognitively normal controls, 1092 with autopsies, from 12 different studies, including white, African American, Israeli-Arab, and Caribbean Hispanic individuals. RESULTS: Unadjusted, CLU (odds ratio [OR], 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.96 for single-nucleotide polymorphism [SNP] rs11136000), CR1 (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.07-1.22; SNP rs3818361), and PICALM (OR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.84-0.94, SNP rs3851179) were associated with AD in white individuals. None were significantly associated with AD in the other ethnic groups. APOE epsilon4 was significantly associated with AD (ORs, 1.80-9.05) in all but 1 small white cohort and in the Arab cohort. Adjusting for age, sex, and the presence of at least 1 APOE epsilon4 allele greatly reduced evidence for association with PICALM but not CR1 or CLU. Models with the main SNP effect, presence or absence of APOE epsilon4, and an interaction term showed significant interaction between presence or absence of APOE epsilon4 and PICALM. CONCLUSIONS: We confirm in a completely independent data set that CR1, CLU, and PICALM are AD susceptibility loci in European ancestry populations. Genotypes at PICALM confer risk predominantly in APOE epsilon4-positive subjects. Thus, APOE and PICALM synergistically interact. :: Notes: Alzheimer's Disease Genetics Consortium :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Citation&list_uids=20697030 :: Author Address: Ophthalmology (Dr Jun), Biostatistics (Drs Jun, Lunetta, and Cupples), Neurology (Dr Farrer), and Genetics and Genomics and Epidemiology (Dr Farrer), Boston University, Boston, and Department of Psychiatry and Epidemiology (Dr Blacker), Massachusetts General Hospital, Charlestown; The John P.

Mutations in the MECP2 protein cause microencephalopathy and are associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders that affect both brain morphology and cognition. Although mutations in MECP2 result in severe neurological phenotypes, the effect of common variation in this genetic region is unknown. We find that common sequence variations in a region in and around MECP2 show association with structural brain size measures in 2 independent cohorts, a discovery sample from the Thematic Organized Psychosis research group, and a replication sample from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. The most statistically significant replicated association (P < 0.025 in both cohorts) involved the minor allele of SNP rs2239464 with reduced cortical surface area, and the finding was specific to male gender in both populations. Variations in the MECP2 region were associated with cortical surface area but not cortical thickness. Secondary analysis showed that this allele was also associated with reduced surface area in specific cortical regions (cuneus, fusiform gyrus, pars triangularis) in both populations. :: Notes: Joyner, Alexander H :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19717458 :: Author Address: Scripps Translational Science Institute, 3344 North Torrey Pines Court, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA.

Many studies have examined brain imaging or cerebrospinal fluid but there is also growing interest in blood biomarkers. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has generated data on 190 plasma analytes in 566 individuals with MCI, AD or normal cognition. We conducted independent analyses of this dataset to identify plasma protein signatures predicting pre-clinical AD. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We focused on identifying signatures that discriminate cognitively normal controls (n = 54) from individuals with MCI who subsequently progress to AD (n = 163). Based on p value, apolipoprotein E (APOE) showed the strongest difference between these groups (p = 2.3 x 10(-13)). We applied a multivariate approach based on combinatorial optimization ((alpha,beta)-k Feature Set Selection), which retains information about individual participants and maintains the context of interrelationships between different analytes, to identify the optimal set of analytes (signature) to discriminate these two groups. We identified 11-analyte signatures achieving values of sensitivity and specificity between 65% and 86% for both MCI and AD groups, depending on whether APOE was included and other factors. Classification accuracy was improved by considering "meta-features," representing the difference in relative abundance of two analytes, with an 8-meta-feature signature consistently achieving sensitivity and specificity both over 85%. Generating signatures based on longitudinal rather than cross-sectional data further improved classification accuracy, returning sensitivities and specificities of approximately 90%. CONCLUSIONS: Applying these novel analysis approaches to the powerful and well-characterized ADNI dataset has identified sets of plasma biomarkers for pre-clinical AD. While studies of independent test sets are required to validate the signatures, these analyses provide a starting point for developing a cost-effective and minimally invasive test capable of diagnosing AD in its pre-clinical stages. :: Notes: Johnstone, Daniel :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22485168 :: Author Address: Priority Research Centre for Bioinformatics, Biomarker Discovery and Information-Based Medicine, The University of Newcastle, Callaghan, New South Wales, Australia.

Approximately 70% of both men and women with MCI have plasma leptin levels lower than the median values of NC. Additionally, half of these subjects carry at least one apolipoprotein-E4 (APOE-epsilon4) allele. A subgroup of participants also had cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leptin measured. Plasma leptin typically reflected the levels of leptin in CSF in all groups (Control/MCI/AD) in both genders. The data suggest that plasma leptin deficiency provides an indication of potential CNS leptin deficiency, further supporting the exploration of plasma leptin as a diagnostic marker for MCI or AD. The important question is whether leptin deficiency plays a role in the causation of AD and/or its progression. If this is the case, individuals with early AD or MCI with low plasma leptin may benefit from leptin replacement therapy. Thus, these data indicate that trials of leptin in low leptin MCI/early-stage AD patients should be conducted to test the hypothesis. :: Notes: Johnston, Jane M :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24359504 :: Author Address: Neurotez, Inc., 991 Highway 22, Suite 200A, Bridgewater, New Jersey 08807, USA. ntezapsidis@neurotez.com.

Distinct phenotypes that depend on the APOE epsilon4 status have been demonstrated. The genetic etiology of APOE epsilon4 non-carriers is still elusive. Thus we investigated the genetic components of AD that is independent of APOE epsilon4 by combining genome association analysis with quantitative trait analyses in non-Hispanic Caucasian participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Five top susceptible single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in three loci in ZNF827, KDM2B and NANP were initially identified in APOE epsilon4 non-carriers and four of these SNPs were confirmed in mild cognitive impairment. These SNPs and one nominally significant SNP are located in three haplotype blocks. Quantitative trait analyses of these haplotype blocks demonstrated that the haplotype block in ZNF827 was associated with CSF Abeta42 level, and the haplotype block in KDM2B with CSF p-tau181p and p-tau181p/Aepsilon42 ratio. The haplotype block between NANP and NINL was associated with brain atrophy. Moreover, these SNPs took additive effects on AD incidence and demonstrated the interaction with APOE epsilon4 status. Therefore, we conclude that these novel loci are associated with AD in APOE epsilon4 non-carriers. This study indicates the distinct genetic risk genes for AD non-carrying APOE epsilon4 and provides new insight to the molecular mechanisms of AD. :: Notes: Jiang, S :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25731621 :: Author Address: Department of Pharmacology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, China.. yu_qiu@hotmail.com.

This study examined baseline GWR and 3-year follow-up diagnostic status in MCI. Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative MCI participants with baseline 1.5 T MRI and 3-year follow-up clinical data were included. Participants were categorized into two groups based on 3-year follow-up diagnoses: 1) non-converters (n = 69, 75 +/- 7, 26 % female), and 2) converters (i.e., dementia at follow-up; n = 69, 75 +/- 7, 30 % female) who were matched on baseline age and Mini-Mental State Examination scores. Groups were compared on FreeSurfer generated baseline GWR from structural images in which higher values represent greater tissue contrast. A general linear model, adjusting for APOE-status, scanner type, hippocampal volume, and cortical thickness, revealed that converters evidenced lower GWR values than non-converters (i.e., more degradation in tissue contrast; p = 0.03). Individuals with MCI who convert to dementia have lower baseline GWR values than individuals who remain diagnostically stable over a 3-year period, statistically independent of cortical thickness or hippocampal volume. :: Notes: Jefferson, Angela L :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24493370 :: Author Address: Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center, Department of Neurology, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, 2525 West End Avenue, 12th Floor - Suite 1200, Nashville, TN, 37203, USA, angela.jefferson@vanderbilt.edu.

However, other than a few disease-associated candidate genes, we know little about the degree to which genetics play a role in the brain networks; we know even less about specific genes that influence brain connections. Twin and family-based studies can generate estimates of overall genetic influences on a trait, but genome-wide association scans (GWASs) can screen the genome for specific variants influencing the brain or risk for disease. To identify the heritability of various brain connections, we scanned healthy young adult twins with high-field, high-angular resolution diffusion MRI. We adapted GWASs to screen the brain's connectivity pattern, allowing us to discover genetic variants that affect the human brain's wiring. The association of connectivity with the SPON1 variant at rs2618516 on chromosome 11 (11p15.2) reached connectome-wide, genome-wide significance after stringent statistical corrections were enforced, and it was replicated in an independent subsample. rs2618516 was shown to affect brain structure in an elderly population with varying degrees of dementia. Older people who carried the connectivity variant had significantly milder clinical dementia scores and lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. As a posthoc analysis, we conducted GWASs on several organizational and topological network measures derived from the matrices to discover variants in and around genes associated with autism (MACROD2), development (NEDD4), and mental retardation (UBE2A) significantly associated with connectivity. Connectome-wide, genome-wide screening offers substantial promise to discover genes affecting brain connectivity and risk for brain diseases. :: Notes: Jahanshad, Neda :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23471985 :: Author Address: Imaging Genetics Center, Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.

We simultaneously solved regression equations with different predictors and used correlated errors among the equations to boost power for associations with brain networks. Connectivity maps were computed to represent the brain's fiber networks from diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans of 200 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We first identified a pattern of brain connections related to clinical decline using standard regressions powered by this large sample size. As AD studies with a large number of diffusion tensor imaging scans are rare, it is important to detect effects in smaller samples using simultaneous regression modeling like SUR. Diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or AD is well known to be associated with ApoE genotype and educational level.

Here we examined the brain’s fiber networks reconstructed from DTI data collected as part of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Diagnosis of AD is associated, to some extent, with a person’s age, educational level, and ApoE genotype. However even the strongest associations are hard to detect in small sample sizes, so efforts to boost power are of great interest. Here, we used a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) approach to combine two underpowered regression models to boost power in limited sample sizes. In the available sample of 111, connectivity was related to MMSE and CDR. Limiting our analysis to 65% of the total subjects, these clinical scores no longer showed significant associations. Power was boosted in the same subsample when incorporating the genotype and education relation to AD in a SUR model. ::  ::  ::

Although ApoE4 may exert an effect on AD risk through amyloidogenic pathways, whether its effect on glucose metabolism is related to Abeta is unknown. To answer this question, we examined data from 175 cognitively normal older people (mean age, 77; 87 men, 88 women) in the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative studied concurrently with [(18)F]flurodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography measures of glucose metabolism and the radiotracer [(18)F]florbetapir, an imaging agent which labels fibrillar Abeta in vivo. Based on a threshold value of florbetapir uptake determined in separate samples, subjects were categorized as florbetapir+ or florbetapir-. Glucose metabolism was measured as a continuous variable in a group of regions of interest (ROIs) selected a priori based on their involvement in AD, and also by using a whole-brain voxelwise approach. Among this sample, 29% of subjects were florbetapir+ and 23% were ApoE4 carriers. As expected, there was a significant association between ApoE4 genotype and florbetapir positivity. Florbetapir status, however, was not significantly associated with glucose metabolism, but the ApoE4 genotype was associated with lower metabolism in both voxelwise and ROI approaches. These results show that ApoE genotype, and not aggregated fibrillar forms of Abeta, contributes to reduced glucose metabolism in aging and adds to a growing list of neural consequences of ApoE that do not appear to be related to Abeta. :: Notes: Jagust, William J :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23238736 :: Author Address: Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720-3190, USA. jagust@berkeley.edu

DESIGN AND SETTING: Longitudinal registries from the Mayo Clinic and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. PATIENTS: Two different samples (n = 343 and n = 598) were created that spanned the cognitive spectrum from normal to Alzheimer disease dementia. Subgroup analyses were performed in members of both cohorts (n = 243 and n = 328) who were amyloid positive at baseline. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The shape of biomarker trajectories as a function of MMSE score, adjusted for age, was modeled and described as baseline (cross-sectional) and within-subject longitudinal effects. Biomarkers evaluated were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta42 and tau levels, amyloid and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging, and structural magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Baseline biomarker values generally worsened (ie, nonzero slope) with lower baseline MMSE score. Baseline hippocampal volume, amyloid positron emission tomography, and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography values plateaued (ie, nonlinear slope) with lower MMSE score in 1 or more analyses. Longitudinally, within-subject rates of biomarker change were associated with worsening MMSE score. Nonconstant within-subject rates (deceleration) of biomarker change were found in only 1 model. CONCLUSIONS: Biomarker trajectory shapes by MMSE score were complex and were affected by interactions with age and APOE status. Nonlinearity was found in several baseline effects models. Nonconstant within-subject rates of biomarker change were found in only 1 model, likely owing to limited within-subject longitudinal follow-up. Creating reliable models that describe the full trajectories of Alzheimer disease biomarkers will require significant additional longitudinal data in individual participants. :: Notes: Jack, Clifford R Jr :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22409939 :: Author Address: Department of Radiology, Mayo Clinic and Foundation, Rochester, Minnesota, USA. jack.clifford@mayo.edu

For example, misfolded Amyloid-ss (Ass) and tau proteins are two neuropathogenic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Mechanisms underlying intra-brain MP propagation/deposition remain essentially uncharacterized. Here, is introduced an epidemic spreading model (ESM) for MP dynamics that considers propagation-like interactions between MP agents and the brain's clearance response across the structural connectome. The ESM reproduces advanced Ass deposition patterns in the human brain (explaining 46 approximately 56% of the variance in regional Ass loads, in 733 subjects from the ADNI database). Furthermore, this model strongly supports a) the leading role of Ass clearance deficiency and early Ass onset age during Alzheimer's disease progression, b) that effective anatomical distance from Ass outbreak region explains regional Ass arrival time and Ass deposition likelihood, c) the multi-factorial impact of APOE e4 genotype, gender and educational level on lifetime intra-brain Ass propagation, and d) the modulatory impact of Ass propagation history on tau proteins concentrations, supporting the hypothesis of an interrelated pathway between Ass pathophysiology and tauopathy. To our knowledge, the ESM is the first computational model highlighting the direct link between structural brain networks, production/clearance of pathogenic proteins and associated intercellular transfer mechanisms, individual genetic/demographic properties and clinical states in health and disease. In sum, the proposed ESM constitutes a promising framework to clarify intra-brain region to region transference mechanisms associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders. :: Notes: Iturria-Medina, Yasser :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25412207 :: Author Address: Montreal Neurological Institute, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

A mathematical model was developed to describe the natural history of change of the Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ) from data obtained in normal elderly, mild cognitive impairment, and mild AD in the AD neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) study. FAQ is a bounded outcome (ranging from 0 to 30), with 0 scored as "no impairment" and 30 as "severely impaired". Since many normal elderly patients had 0 scores and some AD patients had scores of 30 in the ADNI database, a censored approach for handling the boundary data was compared with a standard approach, which ignores the bounded nature of the data. Baseline severity, ApoE4 genotype, age, sex, and imaging biomarkers were tested as covariates. The censored approach greatly improved the predictability of the disease progression in FAQ scores. The basic method for handling boundary data used in this analysis is also applicable to handle boundary observations for numerous other endpoints. :: Notes: Ito, K :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22990808 :: Author Address: Pfizer Inc, Primary Care Business Unit, 445 Eastern Point Road, Groton, CT 06340, USA. kaori.ito@pfizer.com

METHODS: The model was fit to the longitudinal ADAS-cog scores from 817 patients. Risk factors (age, apolipoprotein varepsilon4 [APOE varepsilon4] genotype, gender, family history of AD, years of education) and baseline severity were tested as covariates. RESULTS: Rate of disease progression increased with baseline severity. Age, APOE varepsilon4 genotype, and gender were identified as potential covariates influencing disease progression. The rate of disease progression in patients with mild to moderate AD was estimated as approximately 5.5 points/yr. CONCLUSIONS: A disease progression model adequately described the natural decline of ADAS-cog observed in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Baseline severity is an important covariate to predict a curvilinear rate of disease progression in normal elderly, mild cognitive impairment, and AD patients.

METHODS: Using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)-1/GO data, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) were calculated to quantify the sensitivity of a measure for detecting disease progression and hypothetical treatment effects. All possible combinations of selected sensitive measures were assessed for developing composite scores. The analyses were performed in the MCI population and subpopulations enriched by apolipoprotein E4 (APOE epsilon4), hippocampal volume, and cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid. RESULTS: The best composite score was "Word Recall + Delayed Word Recall + Orientation + CDR-SB + FAQ", more sensitive than 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale or CDR-SB. CONCLUSION: The proposed composite score derived from the existing clinical endpoints demonstrated higher sensitivity in the MCI population and is easy to implement and standardize across studies. :: Notes: Huang, Yifan :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25022537 :: Author Address: Pfizer, Inc., Groton, CT, USA.

Driven by modern applications in genetics and brain sciences, accurate and efficient learning of large-scale BN structures from high-dimensional data becomes a challenging problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Sparse Bayesian Network (SBN) structure learning algorithm that employs a novel formulation involving one L1-norm penalty term to impose sparsity and another penalty term to ensure that the learned BN is a Directed Acyclic Graph--a required property of BNs. Through both theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on 11 moderate and large benchmark networks with various sample sizes, we show that SBN leads to improved learning accuracy, scalability, and efficiency as compared with 10 existing popular BN learning algorithms. We apply SBN to a real-world application of brain connectivity modeling for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and reveal findings that could lead to advancements in AD research. :: Notes: Huang, Shuai :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22665720 :: Author Address: School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, PO Box 878809, Tempe, AZ 85287-8809, USA.

Using inverse-consistent 3D non-linear elastic image registration, we warped 676 individual brain MRI volumes to a population mean geometric template. Jacobian determinant maps were created, revealing the 3D profile of local volumetric expansion and compression. We compared the anatomical distribution of atrophy in 165 AD patients (age: 75.6+/-7.6 years), 330 MCI subjects (74.8+/-7.5), and 181 controls (75.9+/-5.1). Brain atrophy in selected regions-of-interest was correlated with clinical measurements--the sum-of-boxes clinical dementia rating (CDR-SB), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), and the logical memory test scores - at voxel level followed by correction for multiple comparisons. Baseline temporal lobe atrophy correlated with current cognitive performance, future cognitive decline, and conversion from MCI to AD over the following year; it predicted future decline even in healthy subjects. Over half of the AD and MCI subjects carried the ApoE4 (apolipoprotein E4) gene, which increases risk for AD; they showed greater hippocampal and temporal lobe deficits than non-carriers. ApoE2 gene carriers--1/6 of the normal group--showed reduced ventricular expansion, suggesting a protective effect. As an automated image analysis technique, TBM reveals 3D correlations between neuroimaging markers, genes, and future clinical changes, and is highly efficient for large-scale MRI studies. :: Notes: Hua, Xue :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18691658 :: Author Address: Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Department of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine, Neuroscience Research Building 225E, 635 Charles Young Drive, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1769, USA.

Statistical maps revealed significant age and sex differences in atrophic rates. Brain atrophic rates were about 1%-1.5% faster in women than men. Atrophy was faster in younger than older subjects, most prominently in mild cognitive impairment, with a 1% increase in the rates of atrophy and 2% in ventricular expansion, for every 10-year decrease in age. TBM-derived atrophic rates correlated with reduced beta-amyloid and elevated tau levels (n = 363) at baseline, baseline and progressive deterioration in clinical measures, and increasing numbers of risk alleles for the ApoE4 gene.

Methods to compute brain change must be robust to scan quality. Biases may arise if any scans are thrown out, as this can lead to the true changes being overestimated or underestimated. Here we analyzed the full MRI dataset from the first phase of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) from the first phase of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1) and assessed several sources of bias that can arise when tracking brain changes with structural brain imaging methods, as part of a pipeline for tensor-based morphometry (TBM). In all healthy subjects who completed MRI scanning at screening, 6, 12, and 24months, brain atrophy was essentially linear with no detectable bias in longitudinal measures. In power analyses for clinical trials based on these change measures, only 39AD patients and 95 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects were needed for a 24-month trial to detect a 25% reduction in the average rate of change using a two-sided test (alpha=0.05, power=80%). Further sample size reductions were achieved by stratifying the data into Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon4 carriers versus non-carriers. We show how selective data exclusion affects sample size estimates, motivating an objective comparison of different analysis techniques based on statistical power and robustness. TBM is an unbiased, robust, high-throughput imaging surrogate marker for large, multi-site neuroimaging studies and clinical trials of AD and MCI. :: Notes: Hua, Xue :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23153970 :: Author Address: Imaging Genetics Center, Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Dept. of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1769, USA.

In this paper, we propose using various dimensionality reduction methods on both brain structural MRI scans and genomic data, motivated by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. We also consider a new multiple testing adjustment method and compare it with two existing false discovery rate (FDR) adjustment methods. The simulation results suggest an increase in power for the proposed method. The real-data analysis suggests that the proposed procedure is able to find associations between genetic variants and brain volume differences that offer potentially new biological insights. :: Notes: Hua, Wen-Yu :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24963012 :: Author Address: Department of Statistics, Penn State University, State College, PA 16802, USA wxh182@psu.edu.

We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using clinical decline as measured by changes in the Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes as a quantitative trait to test for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were associated with the rate of progression in 822 Caucasian subjects of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). There was no significant association with disease progress for any of the recently identified disease susceptibility variants in CLU, CR1, PICALM, BIN1, EPHA1, MS4A6A, MS4A4E or CD33 following multiple testing correction. We did, however, identify multiple novel loci that reached genome-wide significance at the 0.01 level. These top variants (rs7840202 at chr8 in UBR5: P=4.27 x 10(-14); rs11637611 with a cluster of SNPs at chr15q23 close to the Tay-Sachs disease locus: P=1.07 x 10(-15); and rs12752888 at chr1: P=3.08 x 10(-11)) were also associated with a significant decline in cognition as well as the conversion of subjects with MCI to a diagnosis of AD. Taken together, these variants define approximately 16.6% of the MCI sub-population with a faster rate of decline independent of the other known disease risk factors. In addition to providing new insights into protein pathways that may be involved with the progress to AD in MCI subjects, these variants if further validated may enable the identification of a more homogeneous population of subjects at an earlier stage of disease for testing novel hypotheses and/or therapies in the clinical setting. :: Notes: Hu, X :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22833209 :: Author Address: PharmaTx Precision Medicine, Pfizer, Pfizer Global R&D, Groton, CT, USA.

In this study, we conducted a genome-wide association study in an independent set of 1034 cases and 1186 controls using the Illumina genotyping platforms. By coupling our data with available GWAS datasets from the ADNI and GenADA, we replicated the original associations in both PICALM (rs3851179) and CR1 (rs3818361). The PICALM variant seems to be non-significant after we adjusted for APOE e4 status. We further tested our top markers in 751 independent cases and 751 matched controls. Besides the markers close to the APOE locus, a marker (rs12989701) upstream of BIN1 locus was replicated and the combined analysis reached genome-wide significance level (p = 5E-08). We combined our data with the published Harold et al. study and meta-analysis with all available 6521 cases and 10360 controls at the BIN1 locus revealed two significant variants (rs12989701, p = 1.32E-10 and rs744373, p = 3.16E-10) in limited linkage disequilibrium (r(2) = 0.05) with each other. The independent contribution of both SNPs was supported by haplotype conditional analysis. We also conducted multivariate analysis in canonical pathways and identified a consistent signal in the downstream pathways targeted by Gleevec (P = 0.004 in Pfizer; P = 0.028 in ADNI and P = 0.04 in GenADA). We further tested variants in CLU, PICALM, BIN1 and CR1 for association with disease progression in 597 AD patients where longitudinal cognitive measures are sufficient. Both the PICALM and CLU variants showed nominal significant association with cognitive decline as measured by change in Clinical Dementia Rating-sum of boxes (CDR-SB) score from the baseline but did not pass multiple-test correction. Future experiments will help us better understand potential roles of these genetic loci in AD pathology. :: Notes: Hu, Xiaolan :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21390209 :: Author Address: Molecular Medicine, Pfizer Inc., Groton, Connecticut, United States of America. xiaolan.hu@pfizer.com

Here we aim to determine plasma biomarkers associated with AD in 2 independent cohorts and validate the findings in the multicenter Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). METHODS: Using a targeted proteomic approach, we measured levels of 190 plasma proteins and peptides in 600 participants from 2 independent centers (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia; Washington University, St. Louis, MO), and identified 17 analytes associated with the diagnosis of very mild dementia/mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD. Four analytes (apoE, B-type natriuretic peptide, C-reactive protein, pancreatic polypeptide) were also found to be altered in clinical MCI/AD in the ADNI cohort (n = 566). Regression analysis showed CSF Abeta42 levels and t-tau/Abeta42 ratios to correlate with the number of APOE4 alleles and plasma levels of B-type natriuretic peptide and pancreatic polypeptide. CONCLUSION: Four plasma analytes were consistently associated with the diagnosis of very mild dementia/MCI/AD in 3 independent clinical cohorts. These plasma biomarkers may predict underlying AD through their association with CSF AD biomarkers, and the association between plasma and CSF amyloid biomarkers needs to be confirmed in a prospective study. :: Notes: Hu, William T :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22855860 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia, USA. william.hu@emory.edu

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed MR and genetic data on 662 patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database-198 cognitively normal controls (CN), 321 mild-cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, and 143 AD subjects-looking for dose-dependent effects of the epsilon4 and epsilon2 alleles on hippocampal volumes. Volumes were measured using a fully-automated algorithm applied to high resolution T1-weighted MR images. Statistical analysis consisted of a multivariate regression with repeated-measures model. RESULTS: There was a dose-dependent effect of the epsilon4 allele on hippocampal volume in AD (p = 0.04) and MCI (p = 0.02)-in both cases, each allele accounted for loss of >150 mm(3) (approximately 4%) of hippocampal volume below the mean volume for AD and MCI subjects with no such alleles (Cohen's d = -0.16 and -0.19 for AD and MCI, respectively). There was also a dose-dependent, main effect of the epsilon2 allele (p<0.0001), suggestive of a moderate protective effect on hippocampal volume-an approximately 20% per allele volume increase as compared to CN with no epsilon2 alleles (Cohen's d = 0.23). CONCLUSION: Though no effect of epsilon4 was seen in CN subjects, our findings confirm and extend prior data on the opposing effects of the APOE epsilon4 and epsilon2 alleles on hippocampal morphology across the spectrum of cognitive aging. :: Notes: Hostage, Christopher A :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23405083 :: Author Address: Department of Radiology, Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was approved by the institutional review boards of all participating sites. All subjects and their legal representatives gave written informed consent prior to data collection. The authors analyzed data from 237 subjects (mean age, 79.9 years; 40% female) with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in the ADNI database and assessed the effect of the APOE epsilon4 and epsilon2 alleles on regional brain atrophy rates over a 12-48-month period. Brain regions were selected a priori: 15 experimental and five control regions were included. Regional atrophy rates were derived by using a fully automated algorithm applied to T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data. Analysis consisted of mixed-effects linear regression with repeated measures; results were adjusted for multiple testing with Bonferroni correction. RESULTS: Thirteen of 15 experimental regions showed a significant effect of epsilon4 for higher atrophy rates (P < .001 for all). Cohen d values ranged from 0.26 to 0.42, with the largest effects seen in the amygdalae and hippocampi. The transverse temporal cortex showed a trend (P = .02, but did not survive Bonferroni correction) for a protective effect (Cohen d value = 0.15) of epsilon2. No control region showed an APOE effect. CONCLUSION: The APOE epsilon4 allele is associated with accelerated rates of atrophy in 13 distinct brain regions in limbic and neocortical areas. This suggests the possibility of a genotype-specific network of related brain regions that undergo faster atrophy in MCI and potentially contribute to cognitive decline.

Accumulating evidence suggests that a family history of dementia associates with AD-typical biomarker changes. We analyzed cross-sectional data from non-demented, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and LOAD participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with PET imaging using Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB, n = 99) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis (n = 403) for amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and total tau. We assessed the relationship of CSF and PiB biomarkers and family history of dementia, as well as parent gender effects. In the larger analysis of CSF biomarkers, we assessed diagnosis groups individually. In the overall sample, CSF Abeta, tau/Abeta ratio, and global PiB uptake were significantly different between family history positive and negative groups, with markers of increased AD burden associated with a positive maternal family history of dementia. Moreover, a maternal family history of dementia was associated with significantly greater PiB Abeta load in the brain in the parietal cortex, precuneus, and sensorimotor cortex. Individuals with MCI positive for a maternal family history of dementia had significantly more markers of AD pathophysiology than individuals with no family history of dementia. A family history of dementia is associated with AD-typical biomarker changes. These biomarker associations are most robust in individuals with a maternal family history, suggesting that a maternally inherited factor influences AD risk. :: Notes: Honea, Robyn A :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22669011 :: Author Address: KU Alzheimer's Disease Center, Department of Neurology, University of Kansas School of Medicine, Kansas City, KS 66160, USA. rhonea@kumc.edu

However, traditional genetic association studies have not found a clear relationship between BDNF and AD. Our goal was to test whether BDNF single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) impact Alzheimer's Disease-related brain imaging and cognitive markers of disease. We completed an imaging genetics study on 645 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants (ND=175, MCI=316, AD=154) who had cognitive, brain imaging, and genetics data at baseline and a subset of those with brain imaging data at two years. Samples were genotyped using the Illumina Human610-Quad BeadChip. 13 SNPs in BDNF were identified in the dataset following quality control measures (rs6265(Val66Met), rs12273363, rs11030094, rs925946, rs1050187, rs2203877, rs11030104, rs11030108, rs10835211, rs7934165, rs908867, rs1491850, rs1157459). We analyzed a subgroup of 8 SNPs that were in low linkage disequilibrium with each other. Automated brain morphometric measures were available through ADNI investigators, and we analyzed baseline cognitive scores, hippocampal and whole brain volumes, and rates of hippocampal and whole brain atrophy and rates of change in the ADAS-Cog over one and two years. Three out of eight BDNF SNPs analyzed were significantly associated with measures of cognitive decline (rs1157659, rs11030094, rs11030108). No SNPs were significantly associated with baseline brain volume measures, however six SNPs were significantly associated with hippocampal and/or whole brain atrophy over two years (rs908867, rs11030094, rs6265, rs10501087, rs1157659, rs1491850). We also found an interaction between the BDNF Val66Met SNP and age with whole brain volume. Our imaging-genetics analysis in a large dataset suggests that while BDNF genetic variation is not specifically associated with a diagnosis of AD, it appears to play a role in AD-related brain neurodegeneration. :: Notes: Honea, Robyn A :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24086677 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, University of Kansas Alzheimer's Disease Center, University of Kansas Medical Center, Kansas City, Kansas, United States of America.

We have systematically examined each of these loci to assess whether common coding variability contributes to the risk of disease. We have also assessed the regional expression of all the genes in the brain and whether there is evidence of an eQTL explaining the risk. In agreement with other studies we find that coding variability may explain the ABCA7 association, but common coding variability does not explain any of the other loci. We were not able to show that any of the loci had eQTLs within the power of this study. Furthermore the regional expression of each of the loci did not match the pattern of brain regional distribution in Alzheimer pathology. Although these results are mainly negative, they allow us to start defining more realistic alternative approaches to determine the role of all the genetic loci involved in Alzheimer's disease. ::  :: URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ahg.12000 ::

It is also unclear how these risk factors affect rates of structural brain and clinical decline across the spectrum of preclinical to clinical Alzheimer disease. Our objective is to estimate the effects of apolipoprotein E epsilon4 and sex on age-specific rates of morphometric and clinical decline in late-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With the use of linear mixed-effects models, we examined the effect of age, apolipoprotein E epsilon4, and sex on longitudinal brain atrophy and clinical decline among cognitively normal older individuals and individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer disease (total = 688). We also evaluated the relationship between these effects and CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer disease pathology. RESULTS: Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 significantly accelerated rates of decline, and women in all cohorts had higher rates of decline than men. The magnitude of the sex effect on rates of decline was as large as those of epsilon4, yet their relationship to measures of CSF biomarkers were weaker. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in addition to apolipoprotein E epsilon4 status, diagnostic and therapeutic strategies should take into account the effect of female sex on the Alzheimer disease process. :: Notes: Holland, D :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23828104 :: Author Address: Departments of Neurosciences.

Other evidence has suggested that tau and amyloid pathology may arise independently. Both lines of research suggest that there may be epistatic relationships between genes involved in amyloid and tau pathophysiology. In the current study, we hypothesized that genes coding glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) and comparable tau kinases would modify genetic risk for amyloid plaque pathology. Quantitative amyloid positron emission tomography data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative served as the quantitative outcome in regression analyses, covarying for age, gender, and diagnosis. Three interactions reached statistical significance, all involving the GSK3beta single nucleotide polymorphism rs334543-2 with APBB2 (rs2585590, rs3098914) and 1 with APP (rs457581). These interactions explained 1.2%, 1.5%, and 1.5% of the variance in amyloid deposition respectively. Our results add to a growing literature on the role of GSK-3 activity in amyloid processing and suggest that combined variation in GSK3beta and APP-related genes may result in increased amyloid burden. :: Notes: Hohman, Timothy J :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24112793 :: Author Address: Center for Human Genetics and Research, Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.

The goal of this study was two-fold. First, we sought to identify high-risk vs. low-risk individuals based on their CSF tau and Abeta load and characterize these individuals with regard to brain atrophy in an AD-relevant region of interest. Next, we sought to identify genetic variants that modified the relationship between biomarker classification and neurodegeneration. METHODS: Participants were categorized based on established cut-points for biomarker positivity. Mixed model regression was used to quantify longitudinal change in the left inferior lateral ventricle. Interaction analyses between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and biomarker group status were performed using a genome wide association study (GWAS) approach. Correction for multiple comparisons was performed using the Bonferroni procedure. RESULTS: One intergenic SNP (rs4866650) and one SNP within the SPTLC1 gene (rs7849530) modified the association between amyloid positivity and neurodegeneration. A transcript variant of WDR11-AS1 gene (rs12261764) modified the association between tau positivity and neurodegeneration. These effects were consistent across the two sub-datasets and explained approximately 3% of variance in ventricular dilation. One additional SNP (rs6887649) modified the association between amyloid positivity and baseline ventricular volume, but was not observed consistently across the sub-datasets. CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variation modifies the association between AD biomarkers and neurodegeneration. Genes that regulate the molecular response in the brain to oxidative stress may be particularly relevant to neural vulnerability to the damaging effects of amyloid-beta. :: Notes: Hohman, Timothy J :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25140149 :: Author Address: Department of Molecular Physiology and Biophysics, Center for Human Genetics and Research, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine Nashville, TN, USA.

We sought to identify genetic factors that modify the relationship between phosphorylated tau (PTau) and dilation of the lateral inferior ventricles. METHODS: We used data from 700 subjects enrolled in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). A genome-wide association study approach was used to identify PTau x single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) interactions. Variance explained by these interactions was quantified using hierarchical linear regression. RESULTS: Five SNP x PTau interactions passed a Bonferroni correction, one of which (rs4728029, POT1, 2.6% of variance) was consistent across ADNI-1 and ADNI-2/GO subjects. This interaction also showed a trend-level association with memory performance and levels of interleukin-6 receptor. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that rs4728029 modifies the relationship between PTau and both ventricular dilation and cognition, perhaps through an altered neuroinflammatory response. :: Notes: Hohman, Timothy J :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24656848 :: Author Address: The Center for Human Genetics Research, Department of Molecular Physiology & Biophysics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, USA.

Recent work has begun to address the relationship between these risk variants and biomarkers of AD, though results have been mixed. The aim of the current study was to characterize single marker and epistatic genetic effects between the top candidate Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in relation to amyloid deposition. METHODS: We used a combined dataset across ADNI-1 and ADNI-2, and looked within each dataset separately to validate identified genetic effects. Amyloid was quantified using data acquired by Positron Emission Tomography (PET) with (18)F-AV-45. RESULTS: Two SNP-SNP interactions reached significance when correcting for multiple comparisons, BIN1 (rs7561528, rs744373) x PICALM (rs7851179). Carrying the minor allele in BIN1 was related to higher levels of amyloid deposition, however only in non-carriers of the protective PICALM minor allele. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support previous research suggesting these candidate SNPs do not show single marker associations with amyloid pathology. However, we provide evidence for a novel interaction between PICALM and BIN1 in relation to amyloid deposition. Risk related to the BIN1 minor allele appears to be mitigated in the presence of the PICALM protective variant. In that way, variance in amyloid plaque burden can be better classified within the context of a complex genetic background. Efforts to model cumulative risk for AD should explicitly account for this epistatic effect, and future studies should explicitly test for such effects whenever statistically feasible. :: Notes: Hohman, Timothy J :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24260488 :: Author Address: Center for Human Genetics and Research, Department of Molecular Physiology & Biophysics, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, Tennessee, United States of America.

With >1 billion overweight and 300 million obese persons worldwide, it is crucial to understand the implications of carrying this very common allele for the health of our aging population. FTO is highly expressed in the brain and elevated body mass index (BMI) is associated with brain atrophy, but it is unknown how the obesity-associated risk allele affects human brain structure. We therefore generated 3D maps of regional brain volume differences in 206 healthy elderly subjects scanned with MRI and genotyped as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We found a pattern of systematic brain volume deficits in carriers of the obesity-associated risk allele versus noncarriers. Relative to structure volumes in the mean template, FTO risk allele carriers versus noncarriers had an average brain volume difference of approximately 8% in the frontal lobes and 12% in the occipital lobes-these regions also showed significant volume deficits in subjects with higher BMI. These brain differences were not attributable to differences in cholesterol levels, hypertension, or the volume of white matter hyperintensities; which were not detectably higher in FTO risk allele carriers versus noncarriers. These brain maps reveal that a commonly carried susceptibility allele for obesity is associated with structural brain atrophy, with implications for the health of the elderly. :: Notes: Ho, April J :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20404173 :: Author Address: Laboratory of Neuroimaging, Department of Neurology, University of California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095, USA.

Here we performed genome-wide searches to discover common genetic variants associated with differences in lentiform nucleus volume in human populations. We assessed structural MRI scans of the brain in two large genotyped samples: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; N = 706) and the Queensland Twin Imaging Study (QTIM; N = 639). Statistics of association from each cohort were combined meta-analytically using a fixed-effects model to boost power and to reduce the prevalence of false positive findings. We identified a number of associations in and around the flavin-containing monooxygenase (FMO) gene cluster. The most highly associated SNP, rs1795240, was located in the FMO3 gene; after meta-analysis, it showed genome-wide significant evidence of association with lentiform nucleus volume (P MA = 4.79 x 10(-8)). This commonly-carried genetic variant accounted for 2.68 % and 0.84 % of the trait variability in the ADNI and QTIM samples, respectively, even though the QTIM sample was on average 50 years younger. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed significant contributions of this gene to the cytochrome P450 pathway, which is involved in metabolizing numerous therapeutic drugs for pain, seizures, mania, depression, anxiety, and psychosis. The genetic variants we identified provide replicated, genome-wide significant evidence for the FMO gene cluster's involvement in lentiform nucleus volume differences in human populations. :: Notes: Hibar, Derrek P :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22903471 :: Author Address: Imaging Genetics Center at the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Department of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine, Neuroscience Research Building 225E 635 Charles Young Drive, Los Angeles, CA, 90095-1769, USA.

Subcortical brain regions form circuits with cortical areas to coordinate movement, learning, memory and motivation, and altered circuits can lead to abnormal behaviour and disease. To investigate how common genetic variants affect the structure of these brain regions, here we conduct genome-wide association studies of the volumes of seven subcortical regions and the intracranial volume derived from magnetic resonance images of 30,717 individuals from 50 cohorts. We identify five novel genetic variants influencing the volumes of the putamen and caudate nucleus. We also find stronger evidence for three loci with previously established influences on hippocampal volume and intracranial volume. These variants show specific volumetric effects on brain structures rather than global effects across structures. The strongest effects were found for the putamen, where a novel intergenic locus with replicable influence on volume (rs945270; P = 1.08 x 10-33; 0.52% variance explained) showed evidence of altering the expression of the KTN1 gene in both brain and blood tissue. Variants influencing putamen volume clustered near developmental genes that regulate apoptosis, axon guidance and vesicle transport. Identification of these genetic variants provides insight into the causes of variability in human brain development, and may help to determine mechanisms of neuropsychiatric dysfunction. :: Notes: Hibar, Derrek P :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25607358 :: Author Address: Imaging Genetics Center, Institute for Neuroimaging &Informatics, Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90292, USA.

Interest in genome-wide, brain-wide search for influential genetic variants is growing, but has mainly focused on univariate, SNP-based association tests. Moving to gene-based multivariate statistics, we can test the combined effect of multiple genetic variants in a single test statistic. Multivariate models can reduce the number of statistical tests in gene-wide or genome-wide scans and may discover gene effects undetectable with SNP-based methods. Here we present a gene-based method for associating the joint effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 18,044 genes across 31,662 voxels of the whole brain in 731 elderly subjects (mean age: 75.56+/-6.82SD years; 430 males) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Structural MRI scans were analyzed using tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to compute 3D maps of regional brain volume differences compared to an average template image based on healthy elderly subjects. Using the voxel-level volume difference values as the phenotype, we selected the most significantly associated gene (out of 18,044) at each voxel across the brain. No genes identified were significant after correction for multiple comparisons, but several known candidates were re-identified, as were other genes highly relevant to brain function. GAB2, which has been previously associated with late-onset AD, was identified as the top gene in this study, suggesting the validity of the approach. This multivariate, gene-based voxelwise association study offers a novel framework to detect genetic influences on the brain. :: Notes: Hibar, Derrek P :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21497199 :: Author Address: Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Department of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1769, USA.

Most efforts focus on univariate tests that treat each genetic variation independently, ignoring the joint effects of multiple variants. Instead, we present a gene-based method to detect the joint effect of multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 18,044 genes across 31,662 voxels of the whole brain in a tensor-based morphometry analysis of baseline MRI scans from 731 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our gene-based multivariate statistics use principal components regression to test the combined effect of multiple genetic variants on an image, using a single test statistic. In some situations, which we describe, this can boost power by encoding population variations within each gene, reducing the effective number of statistical tests, and reducing the effect dimension of the search space. Multivariate gene-based methods may discover gene effects undetectable with standard, univariate methods, accelerating ongoing imaging genomics efforts worldwide. ::  ::  ::

Genome-wide search of all possible SNP-SNP interactions is challenging and rarely attempted because of the complexity of conducting approximately 10(11) pairwise statistical tests. However, recent advances in machine learning, for example, iterative sure independence screening, make it possible to analyze data sets with vastly more predictors than observations. Using an implementation of the sure independence screening algorithm (called EPISIS), we performed a genome-wide interaction analysis testing all possible SNP-SNP interactions affecting regional brain volumes measured on magnetic resonance imaging and mapped using tensor-based morphometry. We identified a significant SNP-SNP interaction between rs1345203 and rs1213205 that explains 1.9% of the variance in temporal lobe volume. We mapped the whole brain, voxelwise effects of the interaction in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set and separately in an independent replication data set of healthy twins (Queensland Twin Imaging). Each additional loading in the interaction effect was associated with approximately 5% greater brain regional brain volume (a protective effect) in both Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and Queensland Twin Imaging samples. :: Notes: Hibar, Derrek P :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25264344 :: Author Address: Imaging Genetics Center, Institute for Neuroimaging and Informatics, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Brain images, in particular, provide exquisitely detailed measures of anatomy, function, and connectivity in the living brain, and have identified characteristic features for many neurological and psychiatric disorders. The emerging field of imaging genomics is discovering important genetic variants associated with brain structure and function, which in turn influence disease risk and fundamental cognitive processes. Statistical approaches for testing genetic associations are not straightforward to apply to brain images because the data in brain images is spatially complex and generally high dimensional. Neuroimaging phenotypes typically include 3D maps across many points in the brain, fiber tracts, shape-based analyses, and connectivity matrices, or networks. These complex data types require new methods for data reduction and joint consideration of the image and the genome. Image-wide, genome-wide searches are now feasible, but they can be greatly empowered by sparse regression or hierarchical clustering methods that isolate promising features, boosting statistical power. Here we review the evolution of statistical approaches to assess genetic influences on the brain. We outline the current state of multivariate statistics in imaging genomics, and future directions, including meta-analysis. We emphasize the power of novel multivariate approaches to discover reliable genetic influences with small effect sizes. :: Notes: Hibar, Derrek P :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22303368 :: Author Address: Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Department of Neurology, University of California Los Angeles School of Medicine Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers are a rich source of information that reflect the brain proteome. METHODS: A novel approach was applied to screen a panel of ~190 CSF analytes quantified by multiplex immunoassay, and common associations were detected in the Knight Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (N = 311) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (N = 293) cohorts. Rather than case-control status, the ratio of CSF levels of tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau181) and Abeta42 was used as a continuous trait in these analyses. RESULTS: The ptau181-Abeta42 ratio has more statistical power than traditional modeling approaches, and the levels of CSF heart-type fatty acid binding protein (FABP) and 12 other correlated analytes increase as AD progresses. These results were validated using the traditional case-control status model. Stratification of the dataset demonstrated that increases in these analytes occur very early in the disease course and were apparent even in nondemented individuals with AD pathology (low ptau181, low Abeta42) compared with elderly control subjects with no pathology (low ptau181, high Abeta42). The FABP-Abeta42 ratio demonstrates a similar hazard ratio for disease conversion to ptau181-Abeta42 even though the overlap in classification is incomplete suggesting that FABP contributes independent information as a predictor of AD. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that the approach presented here can be used to identify novel biomarkers for AD correctly and that CSF heart FABP levels start to increase at very early stages of AD. :: Notes: Harari, Oscar :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24548642 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri.

International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention ::  ::  :: Accession Number: 25485448 :: Abstract: In recent imaging genetic studies, much work has been focused on regression analysis that treats large-scale single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and quantitative traits (QTs) as association variables. To deal with the weak detection and high-throughput data problem, feature selection methods such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) are often used for selecting the most relevant SNPs associated with QTs. However, one problem of Lasso as well as many other feature selection methods for imaging genetics is that some useful prior information, i.e., the hierarchical structure among SNPs throughout the whole genome, are rarely used for designing more powerful model. In this paper, we propose to identify the associations between candidate genetic features (i.e., SNPs) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived measures using a tree-guided sparse learning (TGSL) method. The advantage of our method is that it explicitly models the priori hierarchical grouping structure among the SNPs in the objective function for feature selection. Specifically, two kinds of hierarchical structures, i.e., group by gene and group by linkage disequilibrium (LD) clusters, are imposed as a tree-guided regularization term in our sparse learning model. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database show that our method not only achieves better predictions on the two MRI measures (i.e., left and right hippocampal formation), but also identifies the informative SNPs to guide the disease-induced interpretation compared with other reference methods. :: Notes: Hao, Xiaoke :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25485448 ::

However, the genetic backgrounds for normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD in terms of changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of Abeta1-42, T-tau, and P-tau181P, have not been clearly delineated. We carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in order to better define the genetic backgrounds to these three states in relation to CSF levels. METHODS: Subjects were participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The GWAS dataset consisted of 818 participants (mainly Caucasian) genotyped using the Illumina Human Genome 610 Quad BeadChips. This sample included 410 subjects (119 Normal, 115 MCI and 176 AD) with measurements of CSF Abeta1-42, T-tau, and P-tau181P Levels. We used PLINK to find genetic associations with the three CSF biomarker levels. Association of each of the 498,205 SNPs was tested using additive, dominant, and general association models while considering APOE genotype and age. Finally, an effort was made to better identify relevant biochemical pathways for associated genes using the ALIGATOR software. RESULTS: We found that there were some associations with APOE genotype although CSF levels were about the same for each subject group; CSF Abeta1-42 levels decreased with APOE gene dose for each subject group. T-tau levels tended to be higher among AD cases than among normal subjects. From adjusted result using APOE genotype and age as covariates, no SNP was associated with CSF levels among AD subjects. CYP19A1 'aromatase' (rs2899472), NCAM2, and multiple SNPs located on chromosome 10 near the ARL5B gene demonstrated the strongest associations with Abeta1-42 in normal subjects. Two genes found to be near the top SNPs, CYP19A1 (rs2899472, p = 1.90 x 10(-7)) and NCAM2 (rs1022442, p = 2.75 x 10(-7)) have been reported as genetic factors related to the progression of AD from previous studies. In AD subjects, APOE epsilon2/epsilon3 and epsilon2/epsilon4 genotypes were associated with elevated T-tau levels and epsilon4/epsilon4 genotype was associated with elevated T-tau and P-tau181P levels. Pathway analysis detected several biological pathways implicated in Normal with CSF beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta1-42). CONCLUSIONS: Our genome-wide association analysis identified several SNPs as important factors for CSF biomarker. We also provide new evidence for additional candidate genetic risk factors from pathway analysis that can be tested in further studies. :: Notes: Han, Mi-Ryung :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20932310 :: Author Address: Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA.

OBJECTIVES: We evaluated how well the DSI generalizes across four different cohorts: DESCRIPA, ADNI, AddNeuroMed, and the Kuopio MCI study. METHODS: The accuracy of the DSI in predicting progression was examined for each cohort separately using 10 x 10-fold cross-validation and for inter-cohort validation using each cohort as a test set for the model built from the other independent cohorts using bootstrapping with 10 repetitions. Altogether 875 subjects were included in the analysis. The analyzed data included a comprehensive set of age and gender corrected magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features from hippocampal volumetry, multi-template tensor-based morphometry, and voxel-based morphometry as well as Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), APOE genotype, and additional cohort specific data from neuropsychological tests and cerebrospinal fluid measurements (CSF). RESULTS: The DSI model was used to classify the patients into stable and progressive MCI cases. AddNeuroMed had the highest classification results of the cohorts, while ADNI and Kuopio MCI exhibited the lowest values. The MRI features alone achieved a good classification performance for all cohorts. For ADNI and DESCRIPA, adding MMSE, APOE genotype, CSF, and neuropsychological data improved the results. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal that the prediction performance of the combined cohort is close to the average of the individual cohorts. It is feasible to use different cohorts as training sets for the DSI, if they are sufficiently similar. :: Notes: Hall, Anette :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25201784 :: Author Address: Institute of Clinical Medicine, Neurology, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland.

Existing brain amyloid measurement techniques, such as the Pittsburgh Compound B-positron emission tomography and cerebrospinal fluid, are not reasonable first-line approaches limited by either feasibility or cost. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify simple and cost-effective rules that can predict brain Abeta level by integrating both neuropsychological measurements and blood-based markers. METHOD: Several decision tree models were built for extracting the predictive rules based on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort. RESULTS: We successfully extracted predictive rules of Abeta level. For cognitive function variables, cases above the 45th percentile in total cognitive score (TOTALMOD), above the 52nd percentile of delayed word recall, and above the 70th percentile in orientation resulted in a group that was highly enriched for amyloid negative cases. Conversely scoring below the 15th percentile of TOTALMOD resulted in a group highly enriched for amyloid positive cases. For blood protein markers, scoring below the 57th percentile for apolipoprotein E (ApoE) levels (irrespective of genotype) enriched two fold for the risk of being amyloid positive. In the high ApoE cases, scoring above the 60th percentile for transthyretin resulted in a group that was >90% amyloid negative. A third decision tree using both cognitive and blood-marker data slightly improved the classification of cases. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the integration of the neuropsychological measurements and blood-based markers significantly improved prediction accuracy. The prediction model has led to several simple rules, which have a great potential of being naturally translated into clinical settings such as enrichment screening for AD prevention trials of anti-amyloid treatments. :: Notes: Haghighi, Mona :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25147105 :: Author Address: Department of Industrial and Management Systems Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA.

We applied the method to expansion rates of the lateral ventricles, achieving the most powerful ventricular atrophy measure to date. Here, we expand our method's application to tensor-based morphometry measures. We also combine the volumetric tensor-based morphometry measures with previously computed ventricular surface measures into a combined atrophy score. We show that our atrophy scores are longitudinally unbiased with the intercept bias estimated at 2 orders of magnitude below the mean atrophy of control subjects at 1 year. Both approaches yield the most powerful biomarker of atrophy not only for ventricular measures but also for all published unbiased imaging measures to date. A 2-year trial using our measures requires only 31 (22, 43) Alzheimer's disease subjects or 56 (44, 64) subjects with mild cognitive impairment to detect 25% slowing in atrophy with 80% power and 95% confidence. :: Notes: Gutman, Boris A :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25260848 :: Author Address: USC Imaging Genetics Center, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Drug trials using neuroimaging become prohibitively costly if vast numbers of subjects must be assessed, so it is vital to develop efficient measures of brain change. A popular measure of efficiency is the minimal sample size (n80) needed to detect 25% change in a biomarker, with 95% confidence and 80% power. For multivariate measures of brain change, we can directly optimize n80 based on a Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Here we use a supervised learning framework to optimize n80, offering two alternative solutions. With a new medial surface modeling method, we track 3D dynamic changes in the lateral ventricles in 2065 ADNI scans. We apply our LDA-based weighting to the results. Our best average n80-in two-fold nested cross-validation-is 104 MCI subjects (95% CI: [94,139]) for a 1-year drug trial, and 75AD subjects [64,102]. This compares favorably with other MRI analysis methods. The standard "statistical ROI" approach applied to the same ventricular surfaces requires 165 MCI or 94AD subjects. At 2 years, the best LDA measure needs only 67 MCI and 52AD subjects, versus 119 MCI and 80AD subjects for the stat-ROI method. Our surface-based measures are unbiased: they give no artifactual additive atrophy over three time points. Our results suggest that statistical weighting may boost efficiency of drug trials that use brain maps. :: Notes: Gutman, Boris A :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23296188 :: Author Address: Imaging Genetics Center, Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, Dept. of Neurology, UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1769, USA.

The present study aimed to establish a panel of plasma proteins that accurately distinguishes early AD from physiological aging and to compare the findings with previous reports. Fifty-eight healthy controls (CON) and 109 patients with AD dementia were randomly split into a training (40%) and a test (60%) sample. Significant proteins to differentiate between the CON and AD dementia groups were identified in a comprehensive panel of 107 plasma analytes in the training sample; the accuracy in differentiating these 2 groups was explored in the test sample. A set of 5 plasma proteins was identified, which differentiated between the CON group and the AD dementia group with a sensitivity of 89.36% and a specificity of 79.17%. A biological pathway analysis showed that 4 of 5 proteins belonged to a common network with amyloid precursor protein and tau. Apolipoprotein E was the only protein that was both significant in the present report and in a previous proteomic study. The study provides a piece of evidence in support of the feasibility of a blood-based biomarker approach in AD diagnostics; however, further research is required because of issues with replicability. :: Notes: Guo, Liang-Hao :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23314060 :: Author Address: *Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy daggerInstitute for Medical Statistics and Epidemiology, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany double daggerNeuroepidemiology and Ageing Research Unit, School of Public Health, Faculty of Medicine, The Imperial College of Science, Technology, and Medicine, London, UK.

In this study we examine whether ICV modulates the association between clinical disease progression on the one hand and brain atrophy or the apolipoprotein E genotype on the other. Methods: Six hundred seventy-four subjects were studied from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Subjects included 204 controls, 144 patients with AD dementia, and 326 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Longitudinal analyses were conducted applying generalized estimating equations to examine the influence of ICV on clinical deterioration and atrophy progression. Follow-up data were available for up to 60 months after the baseline visit (mean 31.42 months, SD 13.12 months). Results: ICV was not directly associated with clinical worsening or atrophy progression. However, ICV attenuated the impact of atrophy and the apolipoprotein E ε4 allele on clinical disease progression in aMCI. Conclusion: Greater ICV, that is, premorbid brain size, seems to protect against clinical deterioration in the face of AD-related brain atrophy in aMCI. The results support the theory of a compensatory role of brain reserve in contrast to a neuroprotective role. The protective effects of morphologic reserve seem to be limited to early clinical AD; once a certain threshold of neurodegenerative burden is passed, a larger premorbid brain no longer offers an advantage in this context. © 2013 The Alzheimer¢s Association.

The aim of the study was to compare the risk of progression to AD dementia between the four NIA-AA MCI subgroups using data from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative. Patients with MCI were categorised according to the NIA-AA criteria into subgroups with high, intermediate, and low likelihood of the presence of AD pathology (MCI-high, MCI-intermediate, and MCI-unlikely, respectively) or into a group of patients that only met the MCI-core clinical criteria (MCI-core). Data of follow-up visits conducted 6-60 months after baseline were used to compare the relative risk of future AD dementia between the four subgroups employing a Cox regression model. The MCI-high subgroup (N = 22) had a 2.3 times higher risk of developing AD dementia compared with the MCI-core subgroup (N = 327; P = 0.002), while there was a trend for a higher risk in the MCI-high subgroup in contrast to the MCI-intermediate subgroup (N = 31, P = 0.08). No patients in the MCI-unlikely subgroup (N = 17) progressed to AD dementia. Patients with MCI-high have a higher risk for developing AD dementia. The new NIA-AA MCI criteria represent a valuable research instrument that could be incorporated into the diagnostic process of the MCI syndrome after optimisation and refinement. :: Notes: Guo, Liang-Hao :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22932720 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Klinikum rechts der Isar der Technischen Universitat Munchen, Ismaninger Str. 22, 81675 Munich, Germany.

While some new methods have been proposed to more accurately account for such data, these methods are based on iterative algorithms that are slow and failure-prone. In this article, we propose the use of the Sandwich Estimator method which first estimates the parameters of interest with a simple Ordinary Least Square model and second estimates variances/covariances with the "so-called" Sandwich Estimator (SwE) which accounts for the within-subject correlation existing in longitudinal data. Here, we introduce the SwE method in its classic form, and we review and propose several adjustments to improve its behaviour, specifically in small samples. We use intensive Monte Carlo simulations to compare all considered adjustments and isolate the best combination for neuroimaging data. We also compare the SwE method to other popular methods and demonstrate its strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we analyse a highly unbalanced longitudinal dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and demonstrate the flexibility of the SwE method to fit within- and between-subject effects in a single model.

Comparison of single CNVs between cases (MCI and AD) and controls shows overrepresentation of large heterozygous deletions in cases (p-value<0.0001). The analysis of CNV-Regions identifies 44 copy number variable loci of heterozygous deletions, with more CNV-Regions among affected than controls (p=0.005). Seven of the 44 CNV-Regions are nominally significant for association with cognitive impairment. We validated and confirmed our main findings with genome re-sequencing of selected patients and controls. The functional pathway analysis of the genes putatively affected by deletions of CNV-Regions reveals enrichment of genes implicated in axonal guidance, cell-cell adhesion, neuronal morphogenesis and differentiation.

Associations between increased amyloid pathology and cholinergic atrophy have been described in autopsy studies. METHODS: We used structural MRI and AV45-PET amyloid imaging data of 225 cognitively normal or mildly impaired elderly subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative to assess in vivo associations between BF atrophy and cortical amyloid deposition. Associations were examined using region-of-interest (ROI) and voxel-based approaches with reference to cytoarchitectonic mappings of the cholinergic BF nuclei. RESULTS: ROI- and voxel-based approaches yielded complementary evidence for an association between BF volume and cortical amyloid deposition in presymptomatic and predementia stages of AD, irrespective of age, gender, and APOE genotype. CONCLUSIONS: The observed correlations between BF atrophy and cortical amyloid load likely reflect associations between cholinergic degeneration and amyloid pathology as reported in neuropathologic examination studies. :: Notes: Grothe, Michel J :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24418052 :: Author Address: German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Rostock, Germany.

Longitudinal data from cognitively normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were used to calculate sample size requirements for trials using outcome measures, including the Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum of boxes, Mini-Mental State Examination, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale with and without delayed recall, and the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task. We examined the impact on sample sizes of enrichment for genetic and biomarker criteria, including cerebrospinal fluid protein and neuroimaging analyses. We observed little cognitive decline in the CN population at 36 months, regardless of the enrichment strategy. Nonetheless, in CN subjects, using Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Task total as an outcome at 36 months required the fewest subjects across enrichment strategies, with apolipoprotein E genotype epsilon4 carrier status requiring the fewest (n = 499 per arm to demonstrate a 25% reduction in disease progression). In MCI, enrichment reduced the required sample sizes for trials, relative to estimates based on all subjects. For MCI, the Clinical Dementia Rating scale sum of boxes consistently required the smallest sample sizes. We conclude that predementia clinical trial conduct in Alzheimer's disease is enhanced by the use of biomarker inclusion criteria. :: Notes: Grill, Joshua D :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22503160 :: Author Address: Mary S.

Subregions of the HP along the longitudinal axis have been found to demonstrate unique function, as well as undergo differential changes in the progression to AD. Little is known of relationships between such HP subregions and other potential biomarkers, such as neuropsychological (NP), genetic, and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) beta amyloid and tau measures. The purpose of this study was to subdivide the hippocampus to determine how the head, body, and tail were affected in normal control, mild cognitively impaired, and AD subjects, and investigate relationships with HP subregions and other potential biomarkers. MRI scans of 120 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were processed using FreeSurfer, and the HP was subdivided using 3D Slicer. Each subregion was compared among groups, and correlations were used to determine relationships with NP, genetic, and CSF measures. Results suggest that HP subregions are undergoing differential atrophy in AD, and demonstrate unique relationships with NP and CSF data. Discriminant function analyses revealed that these regions, when combined with NP and CSF measures, were able to classify by diagnostic group, and classify MCI subjects who would and would not progress to AD within 12 months. :: Notes: Greene, Sarah J :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22095921 :: Author Address: Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, University of Vermont College of Medicine, Burlington, 05405-0068, USA.

These may provide complementary information for diagnosis and prognosis. We present a multi-modality classification framework in which manifolds are constructed based on pairwise similarity measures derived from random forest classifiers. Similarities from multiple modalities are combined to generate an embedding that simultaneously encodes information about all the available features. Multi-modality classification is then performed using coordinates from this joint embedding. We evaluate the proposed framework by application to neuroimaging and biological data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Features include regional MRI volumes, voxel-based FDG-PET signal intensities, CSF biomarker measures, and categorical genetic information. Classification based on the joint embedding constructed using information from all four modalities out-performs the classification based on any individual modality for comparisons between Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls, as well as between mild cognitive impairment patients and healthy controls. Based on the joint embedding, we achieve classification accuracies of 89% between Alzheimer's disease patients and healthy controls, and 75% between mild cognitive impairment patients and healthy controls. These results are comparable with those reported in other recent studies using multi-kernel learning. Random forests provide consistent pairwise similarity measures for multiple modalities, thus facilitating the combination of different types of feature data. We demonstrate this by application to data in which the number of features differs by several orders of magnitude between modalities. Random forest classifiers extend naturally to multi-class problems, and the framework described here could be applied to distinguish between multiple patient groups in the future. :: Notes: Gray, Katherine R :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23041336 :: Author Address: Biomedical Image Analysis Group, Department of Computing, Imperial College London, UK. krg03@imperial.ac.uk

METHODS: MCI patients were assessed for clinical, cognitive, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography-fluorodeoxyglucose (PET-FDG), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers at baseline and were followed on a yearly basis for 4 years to ascertain progression to AD. Logistic regression models were fitted in clusters, including demographics, APOE genotype, cognitive markers, and biomarkers (morphometric, PET-FDG, CSF, amyloid-beta, and tau). RESULTS: The predictive model at 4 years revealed that two cognitive measures, an episodic memory measure and a Clock Drawing screening test, were the best predictors of conversion (area under the curve = 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: This model of prediction is consistent with the previous model at 2 years, thus highlighting the importance of cognitive measures in progression from MCI to AD.

Markers include regional brain volumes, cerebrospinal fluid measures of pathological Abeta1-42 and total tau, cognitive measures, and individual risk factors. OBJECTIVE: To determine the discriminative utility of different classes of biomarkers and cognitive markers by examining their ability to predict a change in diagnostic status from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer disease. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. PARTICIPANTS: We analyzed the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database to study patients with mild cognitive impairment who converted to Alzheimer disease (n = 116) and those who did not convert (n = 204) within a 2-year period. We determined the predictive utility of 25 variables from all classes of markers, biomarkers, and risk factors in a series of logistic regression models and effect size analyses. SETTING: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative public database. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were odds ratios, pseudo- R(2)s, and effect sizes. RESULTS: In comprehensive stepwise logistic regression models that thus included variables from all classes of markers, the following baseline variables predicted conversion within a 2-year period: 2 measures of delayed verbal memory and middle temporal lobe cortical thickness. In an effect size analysis that examined rates of decline, change scores for biomarkers were modest for 2 years, but a change in an everyday functional activities measure (Functional Assessment Questionnaire) was considerably larger. Decline in scores on the Functional Assessment Questionnaire and Trail Making Test, part B, accounted for approximately 50% of the predictive variance in conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer disease. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive markers at baseline were more robust predictors of conversion than most biomarkers. Longitudinal analyses suggested that conversion appeared to be driven less by changes in the neurobiologic trajectory of the disease than by a sharp decline in functional ability and, to a lesser extent, by declines in executive function. :: Notes: Gomar, Jesus J :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21893661 :: Author Address: Litwin Zucker Alzheimer's Center/Zucker Hillside Hospital/A, Glen Oaks, NY 11004, USA.

To date, imaging genetic studies have mostly focused on discovering isolated genetic effects, typically ignoring potential interactions with non-genetic variables such as disease risk factors, environmental exposures, and epigenetic markers. However, identifying significant interaction effects is critical for revealing the true relationship between genetic and phenotypic variables, and shedding light on disease mechanisms. In this paper, we present a general kernel machine based method for detecting effects of the interaction between multidimensional variable sets. This method can model the joint and epistatic effect of a collection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), accommodate multiple factors that potentially moderate genetic influences, and test for nonlinear interactions between sets of variables in a flexible framework. As a demonstration of application, we applied the method to the data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to detect the effects of the interactions between candidate Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk genes and a collection of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, on hippocampal volume measurements derived from structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Our method identified that two genes, CR1 and EPHA1, demonstrate significant interactions with CVD risk factors on hippocampal volume, suggesting that CR1 and EPHA1 may play a role in influencing AD-related neurodegeneration in the presence of CVD risks. :: Notes: Ge, Tian :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25600633 :: Author Address: Athinoula A.

Although imaging genetics has attracted growing attention and interest, most brain-wide genome-wide association studies focus on voxel-wise single-locus approaches, without taking advantage of the spatial information in images or combining the effect of multiple genetic variants. In this paper we present a fast implementation of voxel- and cluster-wise inferences based on the random field theory to fully use the spatial information in images. The approach is combined with a multi-locus model based on least square kernel machines to associate the joint effect of several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) with imaging traits. A fast permutation procedure is also proposed which significantly reduces the number of permutations needed relative to the standard empirical method and provides accurate small p-value estimates based on parametric tail approximation. We explored the relation between 448,294 single nucleotide polymorphisms and 18,043 genes in 31,662 voxels of the entire brain across 740 elderly subjects from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI). Structural MRI scans were analyzed using tensor-based morphometry (TBM) to compute 3D maps of regional brain volume differences compared to an average template image based on healthy elderly subjects. We find method to be more sensitive compared with voxel-wise single-locus approaches. A number of genes were identified as having significant associations with volumetric changes. The most associated gene was GRIN2B, which encodes the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor NR2B subunit and affects both the parietal and temporal lobes in human brains. Its role in Alzheimer's disease has been widely acknowledged and studied, suggesting the validity of the approach. The various advantages over existing approaches indicate a great potential offered by this novel framework to detect genetic influences on human brains. :: Notes: Ge, Tian :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22800732 :: Author Address: Centre for Computational Systems Biology and School of Mathematical Sciences, Fudan University, Shanghai, China.

One-year brain changes with a distinct frontotemporal pattern have been shown in older adults. However, it is not clear to what extent these changes may have been affected by undetected, early AD. To address this, we estimated 1-year atrophy by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 132 healthy elderly persons who had remained free of diagnosed mild cognitive impairment or AD for at least 3 years. We found significant volumetric reductions throughout the brain. The sample was further divided into low-risk groups based on clinical, biomarker, genetic, or cognitive criteria. Although sample sizes varied, significant reductions were observed in all groups, with rates and topographical distribution of atrophy comparable to that of the full sample. Volume reductions were especially pronounced in the default mode network, closely matching the previously described frontotemporal pattern of changes in healthy aging. Atrophy in the hippocampus predicted change in memory, with no additional default mode network contributions. In conclusion, reductions in regional brain volumes can be detected over the course of 1 year even in older adults who are unlikely to be in a presymptomatic stage of AD. :: Notes: Fjell, Anders M :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23658162 :: Author Address: Research Group for Lifespan Changes in Brain and Cognition, Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, 0317 Oslo, Norway. andersmf@psykologi.uio.no

However, whether the varepsilon2 allele, a possible protective factor for AD, will express its protective effect in terms of cortical thickness in healthy elderly carriers is unclear. The goal of this study is to clarify the effects of APOE genotypes on cortical thickness in nondemented elderly subjects. We used 164 healthy, cognitively normal, elderly subjects, who were grouped into varepsilon2 carriers, varepsilon3 homozygotes, and varepsilon4 carriers respectively. The APOE varepsilon2 carriers had a significant thicker (corrected p<0.05) cortical thickness in the superior temporal cortex compared with the varepsilon3 homozygotes. In addition to this area, the APOE varepsilon2 carriers had a significantly thicker region in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (corrected p<0.05) than did the varepsilon4 carriers. These findings suggest that the different alleles of the APOE gene have distinct neuroanatomic effects in elderly healthy subjects and may play specific roles in the development of AD. :: Notes: Fan, Ming :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20573574 :: Author Address: LIAMA Center for Computational Medicine, National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, PR China.

In the current multicenter study, we tested whether lower BMI is associated with higher core AD brain pathology as assessed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based biological markers of AD in 751 living subjects: 308 patients with AD, 296 subjects with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 147 elderly healthy controls (HC). Based upon a priori cutoff values on CSF concentration of total tau and beta-amyloid (Abeta(1-42)), subjects were binarized into a group with abnormal CSF biomarker signature (CSF+) and those without (CSF-). Results showed that BMI was significantly lower in the CSF+ when compared with the CSF- group (F = 27.7, df = 746, p < 0.001). There was no interaction between CSF signature and diagnosis or apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype. In conclusion, lower BMI is indicative of AD pathology as assessed with CSF-based biomarkers in demented and nondemented elderly subjects. :: Notes: Ewers, Michael :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21684041 :: Author Address: University of California, VA Medical Center, Center for Neuroimaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases , San Francisco, San Francisco, CA 94121, USA. michael.ewers@va.gov

Yet, it is at this stage that treatment is most likely to be effective, so there would be great advantages in improving the diagnosis process. We describe and test a machine learning approach for personalized and cost-effective diagnosis of AD. It uses locally weighted learning to tailor a classifier model to each patient and computes the sequence of biomarkers most informative or cost-effective to diagnose patients. Using ADNI data, we classified AD versus controls and MCI patients who progressed to AD within a year, against those who did not. The approach performed similarly to considering all data at once, while significantly reducing the number (and cost) of the biomarkers needed to achieve a confident diagnosis for each patient. Thus, it may contribute to a personalized and effective detection of AD, and may prove useful in clinical settings. © 1964-2012 IEEE. :: Notes: Cited By (since 1996):2 :: URL: http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84871813342&partnerID=40&md5=97c0ae34330d43bccc7733392f1977fb :: Author Address: Signal Processing and Multimedia Communications Research Group, School of Computing and Mathematics, Plymouth University, Plymouth, PL4 8AA, United Kingdom

We examined the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms tagging common sequence variations in these genes and risk of AD in two case-control samples. We found that the G allele of rs2442607 in microcephalin 1 was associated with an increased risk of AD (under an additive genetic model, P=0.01; odds ratio=3.41; confidence interval, 1.77-6.57). However, this association was not replicated using another case-control sample research participants from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We conclude that the common variations we measured in the 4 microcephaly genes do not affect the risk of AD or that their effect size is small. :: Notes: Erten-Lyons, Deniz :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21297427 :: Author Address: Portland Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR.

Design: Multinational, longitudinal, observational cohort study. Setting: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. Participants: Individuals with a screening diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment or normal cognition (N = 626). Measurements: Mean, variance, and maximum BP were calculated based on measures collected from screening to 36 months. Analysis of covariance models were used to determine the association between BP measures and cognitive scores at 36 months after adjusting for covariates. Results: Greater variability in systolic (P <.05) but not diastolic (P >.18) BP was associated with worse global (Modified Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Cognitive Component and Clinical Dementia Rating sum of boxes) and executive (Trail-Making Test Part B, Animal Fluency, and Vegetable Fluency) function and episodic memory (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test Total Score). Conclusion: There is a clinically significant association between greater systolic BP variability and greater cognitive dysfunction. These results should be verified in other well-characterized cohorts, and the neuroanatomical pathophysiology underlying the observed greater cognitive impairment should be further explored. © 2013, The American Geriatrics Society. :: Notes: Export Date: 28 May 2014 :: URL: http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84890515024&partnerID=40&md5=475e159234d339ec0511045f8e0c12c6 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, Hines VA Medical Center, 5000 South 5th Avenue, Hines, IL 60141, United States

The elderly are often treated with several medications, which may have both beneficial and deleterious effects. The use and type of medication in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and association with falls is limited. Objective: We examined the association between falls and medication use in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Methods: Diagnosis, demographics, medication use, apolipoprotein E4 allele status and functional activity level at baseline were gathered for 810 participants enrolled in the ADNI, including healthy controls and subjects with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's. Reports detailing adverse event falls were tabulated. Baseline characteristics were compared between subjects with and without one or more falls. Cox proportional hazards models were conducted to evaluate the association between subject characteristics and hazard of the first fall. Results: Age (p < 0.0001), Functional Activities Questionnaire (p = 0.035), Beers List (p = 0.0477) and medications for treating cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer's (p = 0.0019) were associated with hazard of fall in the univariate model. In the final multivariate model, after adjusting for covariates, Alzheimer's medication use (p = 0.0005) was associated with hazard of fall. Medication was changed by the clinician after an adverse fall event in 9 % of the falls. About 7 % of the falls were reported as serious adverse events and 6 % were reported to be severe. Conclusion: We found a significant association between the use of symptomatic medication treating cognitive symptoms in AD and hazard of fall after adjusting for age and Beers List medication use. Additional pharmacovigilance of the association between falls and Alzheimer's medication use is warranted. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland. :: Notes: Export Date: 28 May 2014 :: URL: http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84894097377&partnerID=40&md5=c7ac4bd4985eb2b5e6f6bff9c5c1189b :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, Hines VA Medical Center, 5000 South 5th Avenue, Hines, IL 60141, United States

METHODS: Cluster analysis was performed on neuropsychological data from 825 MCI ADNI participants. RESULTS: Four subtypes emerged: (1) dysnomic (n = 153), (2) dysexecutive (n = 102), (3) amnestic (n = 288), and (4) cluster-derived normal (n = 282) who performed within normal limits on cognitive testing. The cluster-derived normal group had significantly fewer APOE epsilon4 carriers and fewer who progressed to dementia compared with the other subtypes; they also evidenced cerebrospinal fluid Alzheimer's disease biomarker profiles that did not differ from the normative reference group. CONCLUSIONS: Identification of empirically derived MCI subtypes demonstrates heterogeneity in MCI cognitive profiles that is not captured by conventional criteria. The large cluster-derived normal group suggests that conventional diagnostic criteria are susceptible to false-positive errors, with the result that prior MCI studies may be diluting important biomarker relationships. :: Notes: Edmonds, Emily C :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857234 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, USA.

For example, in Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) cases eligible for the study are nearly two times the Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients for structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modality and six times the control cases for proteomics modality. Constructing an accurate classifier from imbalanced data is a challenging task. Traditional classifiers that aim to maximize the overall prediction accuracy tend to classify all data into the majority class. In this paper, we study an ensemble system of feature selection and data sampling for the class imbalance problem. We systematically analyze various sampling techniques by examining the efficacy of different rates and types of undersampling, oversampling, and a combination of over and undersampling approaches. We thoroughly examine six widely used feature selection algorithms to identify significant biomarkers and thereby reduce the complexity of the data. The efficacy of the ensemble techniques is evaluated using two different classifiers including Random Forest and Support Vector Machines based on classification accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity measures. Our extensive experimental results show that for various problem settings in ADNI, (1) a balanced training set obtained with K-Medoids technique based undersampling gives the best overall performance among different data sampling techniques and no sampling approach; and (2) sparse logistic regression with stability selection achieves competitive performance among various feature selection algorithms. Comprehensive experiments with various settings show that our proposed ensemble model of multiple undersampled datasets yields stable and promising results. :: Notes: Dubey, Rashmi :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24176869 :: Author Address: School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA; Center for Evolutionary Medicine and Informatics, The Biodesign Institute, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ, USA.

International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention ::  :: PMCID: 4203420 :: Accession Number: 25320816 :: Abstract: Brain imaging genetics is an emergent research field where the association between genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and neuroimaging quantitative traits (QTs) is evaluated. Sparse canonical correlation analysis (SCCA) is a bi-multivariate analysis method that has the potential to reveal complex multi-SNP-multi-QT associations. Most existing SCCA algorithms are designed using the soft threshold strategy, which assumes that the features in the data are independent from each other. This independence assumption usually does not hold in imaging genetic data, and thus inevitably limits the capability of yielding optimal solutions. We propose a novel structure-aware SCCA (denoted as S2CCA) algorithm to not only eliminate the independence assumption for the input data, but also incorporate group-like structure in the model. Empirical comparison with a widely used SCCA implementation, on both simulated and real imaging genetic data, demonstrated that S2CCA could yield improved prediction performance and biologically meaningful findings. :: Notes: Du, Lei :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320816 ::

OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the feasibility of a cognitive composite outcome for clinically normal elderly participants with evidence of AD pathology using the ADCS Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite (ADCS-PACC). The ADCS-PACC combines tests that assess episodic memory, timed executive function, and global cognition. The ADCS-PACC is the primary outcome measure for the first clinical trial in preclinical AD (ie, the Anti-Amyloid Treatment in Asymptomatic Alzheimer's study). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: With the ADCS-PACC, we derive pilot estimates of amyloid-related decline using data from 2 observational studies conducted in North America and another conducted in Australia. The participants analyzed had normal cognition and mean ages of 75.81, 71.37, and 79.42 years across the 3 studies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: For the 2 studies that collected data on Abeta levels (ADNI and AIBL), we estimate decline in a preclinical AD "Abeta-positive" placebo group and compare them with an "Abeta-negative" group. For the study that did not include data on Abeta levels (the ADCS Prevention Instrument [ADCS-PI] study), we grouped participants by the presence of APOE-epsilon4 and by clinical progression. RESULTS: In ADNI, Abeta-positive participants showed more decline than did Abeta-negative participants with regard to the ADCS-PACC score at 24 months (mean [SE] difference, -1.239 [0.522] [95% CI, -2.263 to -0.215]; P = .02). In AIBL, the mean (SE) difference is significant at both 18 months (-1.009 [0.406] [95% CI, -1.805 to -0.213]; P = .01) and 36 months (-1.404 [0.452] [95% CI, -2.290 to -0.519]; P = .002). In the ADCS-PI study, APOE-epsilon4 allele carriers performed significantly worse on the ADCS-PACC at 24 months (mean [SE] score, -0.742 [0.294] [95% CI, -1.318 to -0.165]; P = .01) and 36 months (-1.531 [0.469] [95% CI, -2.450 to -0.612]; P = .001). In the ADCS-PI study, cognitively normal participants who progress from a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 are significantly worse on the ADCS-PACC than cognitively normal participants who are stable with a global Clinical Dementia Rating score of 0 at months 12, 24, and 36 (mean [SE] ADCS-PACC score, -4.471 [0.702] [95% CI, -5.848 to -3.094]; P < .001). Using pilot estimates of variance and assuming 500 participants per group with 30% attrition and a 5% alpha level, we project 80% power to detect effects in the range of Delta = 0.467 to 0.733 on the ADCS-PACC. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Analyses of at-risk cognitively normal populations suggest that we can reliably measure the first signs of cognitive decline with the ADCS-PACC. These analyses also suggest the feasibility of secondary prevention trials. :: Notes: Donohue, Michael C :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886908 :: Author Address: Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics, Department of Family and Preventive Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla2Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study, Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla.

DESIGN: Baseline plasma screening of 151 multiplexed analytes combined with targeted biomarker and clinical pathology data. SETTING: General community-based, prospective, longitudinal study of aging. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 754 healthy individuals serving as controls and 207 participants with AD from the Australian Imaging Biomarker and Lifestyle study (AIBL) cohort with identified biomarkers that were validated in 58 healthy controls and 112 individuals with AD from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. RESULTS: A biomarker panel was identified that included markers significantly increased (cortisol, pancreatic polypeptide, insulinlike growth factor binding protein 2, beta(2) microglobulin, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, carcinoembryonic antigen, matrix metalloprotein 2, CD40, macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha, superoxide dismutase, and homocysteine) and decreased (apolipoprotein E, epidermal growth factor receptor, hemoglobin, calcium, zinc, interleukin 17, and albumin) in AD. Cross-validated accuracy measures from the AIBL cohort reached a mean (SD) of 85% (3.0%) for sensitivity and specificity and 93% (3.0) for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. A second validation using the ADNI cohort attained accuracy measures of 80% (3.0%) for sensitivity and specificity and 85% (3.0) for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified a panel of plasma biomarkers that distinguish individuals with AD from cognitively healthy control subjects with high sensitivity and specificity. Cross-validation within the AIBL cohort and further validation within the ADNI cohort provides strong evidence that the identified biomarkers are important for AD diagnosis. :: Notes: Doecke, James D :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22801742 :: Author Address: The Australian E-Health Research Centre, Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital, Herston, Queensland, Australia.

At the same time, tens-of-thousands of computational algorithms are developed and reported in the literature along with thousands of software tools and services. Users demand intuitive, quick and platform-agnostic access to data, software tools, and infrastructure from millions of hardware devices. This explosion of information, scientific techniques, computational models, and technological advances leads to enormous challenges in data analysis, evidence-based biomedical inference and reproducibility of findings. The Pipeline workflow environment provides a crowd-based distributed solution for consistent management of these heterogeneous resources. The Pipeline allows multiple (local) clients and (remote) servers to connect, exchange protocols, control the execution, monitor the states of different tools or hardware, and share complete protocols as portable XML workflows. In this paper, we demonstrate several advanced computational neuroimaging and genetics case-studies, and end-to-end pipeline solutions.

METHODS: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset was interrogated for a primary sample of patients with very mild AD dementia (n=100) and a secondary confirmatory sample of patients with mild cognitive impairment (n=396). An executive predominant subgroup was defined as having executive performance >/=2 SDs worse than memory performance and a memory predominant subgroup was defined conversely. A priori regions of interest from a previous study of an AD patient sample were used to obtain cortical thickness measures. RESULTS: Despite equivalent global measures of impairment (Mini-Mental State Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Sum of Boxes), executive predominant patients (n=88) were more impaired on other executive measures and in the CDR Judgement and Problem Solving box (p<0.005) while memory predominant patients (n=56) were more impaired on other memory measures (p<0.05). The APOE-epsilon4 allele was much more frequent in the memory predominant subgroup (p<0.0001). Frontoparietal cortical regions were thinner in the executive predominant group than in the memory predominant group (p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: A dysexecutive clinical phenotype of very mild AD is not rare and is associated with more problem solving difficulties and possibly more rapid progression compared with patients with a predominant amnesic phenotype. Executive predominant AD may reflect an alternative underlying pathophysiology related to genetic status, reflected in more prominent pathological alterations in frontoparietal regions subserving executive function. These findings, which deserve further investigation, may have implications for diagnosis, prognostication, monitoring and related issues involved in clinical research and care. :: Notes: Dickerson, Bradford C :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562467 :: Author Address: MGH Frontotemporal Dementia Unit, Boston, Massachusetts, USA. bradd@nmr.mgh.harvard.edu

American journal of neuroradiology :: ISSN: 1936-959X (Electronic) :: PMCID: 4041629 :: Accession Number: 22976236 :: Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Among cognitively healthy older individuals, the relationship among the 2 hallmark proteins of AD (Abeta and tau APOE epsilon4) and neurodegeneration is not well-understood. Here, we investigated the relationship between Abeta, p-tau, and APOE epsilon4 on longitudinal brain atrophy in preclinical AD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 107 cognitively healthy older adults who underwent longitudinal MR imaging and baseline lumbar puncture. Within the same linear mixed-effects model, we concurrently investigated main and interactive effects between the APOE epsilon4 genotype and CSF Abeta(1-42), CSF p-tau and CSF Abeta(1-42), and the APOE epsilon4 genotype and CSF p-tau on entorhinal cortex atrophy rate. We also examined the relationship of APOE epsilon4, CSF p-tau, and CSF Abeta(1-42) on the atrophy rate of other AD-vulnerable neuroanatomic regions. RESULTS: The full model with main and interactive effects demonstrated a significant interaction only between CSF p-tau and CSF Abeta(1-42) on entorhinal cortex atrophy rate, indicating elevated atrophy with time in individuals with increased CSF p-tau and decreased CSF Abeta(1-42). The APOE epsilon4 genotype was significantly and specifically associated with CSF Abeta(1-42). However, the interaction between the APOE epsilon4 genotype and either CSF Abeta(1-42) or CSF p-tau on entorhinal cortex atrophy rate was not significant. We found similar results in other AD-vulnerable regions. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of our findings and building on prior experimental evidence, we propose a model of the pathogenic cascade underlying preclinical AD in which APOE epsilon4 primarily influences the pathology of Alzheimer disease via Abeta-related mechanisms, and in turn, Abeta-associated neurodegeneration occurs only in the presence of p-tau. :: Notes: Desikan, R S :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22976236 :: Author Address: Department of Radiology, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92037-0841, USA. rdesikan@ucsd.edu

DESIGN: Mixture modeling approach. SETTING: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. PATIENTS OR OTHER PARTICIPANTS: Cognitively normal persons, patients with AD, and individuals with mild cognitive impairment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cerebrospinal fluid-derived beta-amyloid protein 1-42, total tau protein, and phosphorylated tau(181P) protein concentrations were used as biomarkers on a clinically well-characterized data set. The outcome of the qualification analysis was validated on 2 additional data sets, 1 of which was autopsy confirmed. RESULTS: Using the US Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set, a cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid protein 1-42/phosphorylated tau(181P) biomarker mixture model identified 1 feature linked to AD, while the other matched the "healthy" status. The AD signature was found in 90%, 72%, and 36% of patients in the AD, mild cognitive impairment, and cognitively normal groups, respectively. The cognitively normal group with the AD signature was enriched in apolipoprotein E epsilon4 allele carriers. Results were validated on 2 other data sets. In 1 study consisting of 68 autopsy-confirmed AD cases, 64 of 68 patients (94% sensitivity) were correctly classified with the AD feature. In another data set with patients (n = 57) with mild cognitive impairment followed up for 5 years, the model showed a sensitivity of 100% in patients progressing to AD. CONCLUSIONS: The mixture modeling approach, totally independent of clinical AD diagnosis, correctly classified patients with AD. The unexpected presence of the AD signature in more than one-third of cognitively normal subjects suggests that AD pathology is active and detectable earlier than has heretofore been envisioned. :: Notes: De Meyer, Geert :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20697045 :: Author Address: Innogenetics, Industriepark Zwijnaarde 7, Box 4, B-9052 Gent, Belgium.

Because common neuronal mechanisms may mediate the adaptation to diverse cerebral insults, we hypothesized that susceptibility for age-related cognitive decline may be due in part to a shared genetic network. We have therefore performed a genome-wide association study using a quantitative measure of global cognitive decline slope, based on repeated measures of 17 cognitive tests in 749 subjects from the Religious Orders Study. Top results were evaluated in 3 independent replication cohorts, consisting of 2279 additional subjects with repeated cognitive testing. As expected, we find that the Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility locus, APOE, is strongly associated with rate of cognitive decline (P(DISC) = 5.6 x 10(-9); P(JOINT)= 3.7 x 10(-27)). We additionally discover a variant, rs10808746, which shows consistent effects in the replication cohorts and modestly improved evidence of association in the joint analysis (P(DISC) = 6.7 x 10(-5); P(REP) = 9.4 x 10(-3); P(JOINT) = 2.3 x 10(-5)). This variant influences the expression of 2 adjacent genes, PDE7A and MTFR1, which are potential regulators of inflammation and oxidative injury, respectively. Using aggregate measures of genetic risk, we find that known susceptibility loci for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and inflammatory diseases are not significantly associated with cognitive decline in our cohort. Our results suggest that intermediate phenotypes, when coupled with larger sample sizes, may be a useful tool to dissect susceptibility loci for age-related cognitive decline and uncover shared molecular pathways with a role in neuronal injury. :: Notes: De Jager, Philip L :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22054870 :: Author Address: Institute for the Neurosciences, Department of Neurology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA. pdejager@rics.bwh.harvard.edu

Our results confirm significantly decreased connectivity in the default mode network in healthy older APOE epsilon4 carriers compared with epsilon3 homozygotes. More important, further testing revealed a significant interaction between APOE genotype and gender in the precuneus, a major default mode hub. Female epsilon4 carriers showed significantly reduced default mode connectivity compared with either female epsilon3 homozygotes or male epsilon4 carriers, whereas male epsilon4 carriers differed minimally from male epsilon3 homozygotes. An additional analysis in an independent sample of healthy elderly using an independent marker of Alzheimer's disease, i.e., spinal fluid levels of tau, provided corresponding evidence for this gender-by-APOE interaction. Together, these results converge with previous work showing a higher prevalence of the epsilon4 allele among women with Alzheimer's disease and, critically, demonstrate that this interaction between APOE genotype and gender is detectable in the preclinical period. :: Notes: Damoiseaux, Jessica S :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22699906 :: Author Address: Functional Imaging in Neuropsychiatric Disorders Laboratory, Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California 94305, USA. jeske@stanford.edu

SPARE-AD was first established as a highly sensitive and specific MRI-marker of AD vs. cognitively normal (CN) subjects (AUC = 0.98). Baseline predictive values of all aforementioned indices were then compared using survival analysis on 381 MCI subjects. SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog were found to have similar predictive value, and their combination was significantly better than their individual performance. APOE genotype did not significantly improve prediction, although the combination of SPARE-AD, ADAS-Cog and APOE epsilon4 provided the highest hazard ratio estimates of 17.8 (last vs. first quartile). In a subset of 192 MCI patients who also had CSF biomarkers, the addition of Abeta1-42, t-tau, and p-tau181p to the previous model did not improve predictive value significantly over SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog combined. Importantly, in amyloid-negative patients with MCI, SPARE-AD had high predictive power of clinical progression. Our findings suggest that SPARE-AD and ADAS-Cog in combination offer the highest predictive power of conversion from MCI to AD, which is improved, albeit not significantly, by APOE genotype. The finding that SPARE-AD in amyloid-negative MCI patients was predictive of clinical progression is not expected under the amyloid hypothesis and merits further investigation. :: Notes: Da, Xiao :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24371799 :: Author Address: Section of Biomedical Image Analysis, Department of Radiology, and Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA.

The linkage disequilibrium pattern around the APOE gene has made it difficult to determine whether all the association signal is derived from APOE or whether there is an independent signal from a nearby gene. OBJECTIVE: To attempt to replicate a recently reported association of APOE 3-TOMM40 haplotypes with risk and age at onset. DESIGN: We used standard techniques to genotype several polymorphisms in the APOE-TOMM40 region in a large case-control series, in a series with cerebrospinal fluid biomarker data, and in brain tissue. SETTING: Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. PARTICIPANTS: Research volunteers who were cognitively normal or had Alzheimer disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease status and age at onset. RESULTS: We did not replicate the previously reported association of the polyT polymorphism (rs10524523) with risk and age at onset. We found a significant association between rs10524523 and risk of LOAD in APOE 33 homozygotes but in the opposite direction as the previously reported association (the very long allele was underrepresented in cases vs controls in this study (P = .004]). We found no association between rs10524523 and cerebrospinal fluid tau or beta-amyloid 42 levels or TOMM40 or APOE gene expression. CONCLUSIONS: Although we did not replicate the earlier association between the APOE 3-TOMM40 haplotypes and age at onset, we observed that the polyT polymorphism is associated with risk of LOAD in APOE 33 homozygotes in a large case-control series but in the opposite direction as in the previous study. :: Notes: Cruchaga, Carlos :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21825236 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.

We have access to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma APOE protein levels from 641 individuals and genome-wide genotyped data from 570 of these samples. The aim of this study was to test whether CSF or plasma APOE levels could be a useful endophenotype for AD and to identify genetic variants associated with APOE levels. We found that CSF (P = 8.15 x 10(-4)) but not plasma (P = 0.071) APOE protein levels are significantly associated with CSF Abeta(42) levels. We used Mendelian randomization and genetic variants as instrumental variables to confirm that the association of CSF APOE with CSF Abeta(42) levels and clinical dementia rating (CDR) is not because of a reverse causation or confounding effect. In addition the association of CSF APOE with Abeta(42) levels was independent of the APOE epsilon4 genotype, suggesting that APOE levels in CSF may be a useful endophenotype for AD. We performed a genome-wide association study to identify genetic variants associated with CSF APOE levels: the APOE epsilon4 genotype was the strongest single-genetic factor associated with CSF APOE protein levels (P = 6.9 x 10(-13)). In aggregate, the Illumina chip single nucleotide polymorphisms explain 72% of the variability in CSF APOE protein levels, whereas the APOE epsilon4 genotype alone explains 8% of the variability. No other genetic variant reached the genome-wide significance threshold, but nine additional variants exhibited a P-value <10(-6). Pathway mining analysis indicated that these nine additional loci are involved in lipid metabolism (P = 4.49 x 10(-9)). :: Notes: Cruchaga, Carlos :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22821396 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, MO 63110, USA.

While large genome-wide association studies have had some success in identifying novel genetic risk factors for AD, case-control studies are less likely to uncover genetic factors that influence progression of disease. An alternative approach to identifying genetic risk for AD is the use of quantitative traits or endophenotypes. The use of endophenotypes has proven to be an effective strategy, implicating genetic risk factors in several diseases, including anemia, osteoporosis and heart disease. In this study we identify a genetic factor associated with the rate of decline in AD patients and present a methodology for identification of other such factors. We have used an established biomarker for AD, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau(181)) levels as an endophenotype for AD, identifying a SNP, rs1868402, in the gene encoding the regulatory sub-unit of protein phosphatase B, associated with CSF ptau(181) levels in two independent CSF series (P(combined) = 1.17 x 10(-05)). We show no association of rs1868402 with risk for AD or age at onset, but detected a very significant association with rate of progression of disease that is consistent in two independent series (P(combined) = 1.17 x 10(-05)). Our analyses suggest that genetic variants associated with CSF ptau(181) levels may have a greater impact on rate of progression, while genetic variants such as APOE4, that are associated with CSF Abeta(42) levels influence risk and onset but not the rate of progression. Our results also suggest that drugs that inhibit or decrease tau phosphorylation may slow cognitive decline in individuals with very mild dementia or delay the appearance of memory problems in elderly individuals with low CSF Abeta(42) levels. Finally, we believe genome-wide association studies of CSF tau/ptau(181) levels should identify novel genetic variants which will likely influence rate of progression of AD. :: Notes: Cruchaga, Carlos :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20862329 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, Missouri, USA. cruchagc@psychiatry.wustl.edu

However, Abeta peptides' functions are not fully understood and seem to be highly pleiotropic. We hypothesized that plasma Abeta peptides concentrations could be a suitable endophenotype for a genome-wide association study (GWAS) designed to (i) identify novel genetic factors involved in amyloid precursor protein metabolism and (ii) highlight relevant Abeta-related physiological and pathophysiological processes. Hence, we performed a genome-wide association meta-analysis of four studies totaling 3 528 healthy individuals of European descent and for whom plasma Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 peptides levels had been quantified. Although we did not observe any genome-wide significant locus, we identified 18 suggestive loci (P<1 x 10(-)(5)). Enrichment-pathway analyses revealed canonical pathways mainly involved in neuronal functions, for example, axonal guidance signaling. We also assessed the biological impact of the gene most strongly associated with plasma Abeta1-42 levels (cortexin 3, CTXN3) on APP metabolism in vitro and found that the gene protein was able to modulate Abeta1-42 secretion. In conclusion, our study results suggest that plasma Abeta peptides levels are valid endophenotypes in GWASs and can be used to characterize the metabolism and functions of APP and its metabolites. :: Notes: Chouraki, V :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24535457 :: Author Address: 1] INSERM U744, Lille, France [2] Institut pasteur de Lille, Lille, France [3] Universite Lille-Nord de France, Lille, France.

We also assessed correlations between emerging CSF biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease pathology and localizable deficits in the brain, in 80 AD, 80 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 80 healthy controls from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Six expertly segmented images and their embedded parametric mesh surfaces were fluidly registered to each brain; segmentations were averaged within subjects to reduce errors. Surface-based statistical maps revealed powerful correlations between surface morphology and 4 variables: (1) diagnosis, (2) depression severity, (3) cognitive function at baseline, and (4) future cognitive decline over the following year. Cognitive function was assessed using the mini-mental state exam (MMSE), global and sum-of-boxes clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores, at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Lower CSF Abeta(1-42) protein levels, a biomarker of AD pathology assessed in 138 of the 240 subjects, were correlated with lateral ventricular expansion. Using false discovery rate (FDR) methods, 40 and 120 subjects, respectively, were needed to discriminate AD and MCI from normal groups. 120 subjects were required to detect correlations between ventricular enlargement and MMSE, global CDR, sum-of-boxes CDR and clinical depression scores.

Apolipoprotein varepsilon4 (APOE varepsilon4), a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, is also known to be associated with hippocampal volume loss. No studies have considered the effects of amyloid pathology and APOE varepsilon4 together on longitudinal volume loss. METHODS: We evaluated whether an abnormal level of cerebrospinal fluid beta-amyloid (CSF Abeta) and APOE varepsilon4 carrier status were independently associated with greater hippocampal volume loss over 1 year. We then assessed whether APOE varepsilon4 status and CSF Abeta acted synergistically, testing the significance of an interaction term in the regression analysis. We included 297 participants: 77 cognitively normal, 144 with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 76 with Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: An abnormal CSF Abeta level was found to be associated with greater hippocampal volume loss over 1 year in each group. APOE varepsilon4 was associated with hippocampal volume loss only in the cognitively normal and MCI groups. APOE varepsilon4 carriers with abnormal CSF Abeta in the MCI group acted synergistically to produce disproportionately greater volume loss than noncarriers. CONCLUSION: Baseline CSF Abeta predicts progression of hippocampal volume loss. APOE varepsilon4 carrier status amplifies the degree of neurodegeneration in MCI. Understanding the effect of interactions between genetic risk and amyloid pathology will be important in clinical trials and our understanding of the disease process. :: Notes: Chiang, Gloria C :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21889115 :: Author Address: Department of Radiology, University of California, San Francisco, USA. gloria.chiang@radiology.ucsf.edu

We also determined whether APOE2 carriers have less Alzheimer pathology as reflected by CSF biomarkers. METHODS: We included longitudinal data from 134 cognitively normal individuals (27 APOE2/2 or E2/3, 107 APOE3/3) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, a prospective cohort study. A linear mixed-effects model was used to determine how APOE2 affected rates of hippocampal atrophy and cognitive change over time. In a subsample of 72 individuals who also underwent CSF analysis, an ordinary least-squares regression was used to determine whether CSF beta-amyloid (Abeta), total tau, and phosphorylated tau-181 (p-tau) differed by APOE2 status. RESULTS: APOE2 carriers demonstrated slower rates of hippocampal atrophy (p = 0.004). The mean rate of hippocampal atrophy among APOE2 carriers was -33 mm(3)/year (95% confidence interval -65 to +0.4), or -0.5%/year, compared to -86 mm(3)/year (95% confidence interval -102 to -71), or -1.3%/year, in the APOE3/3 group. No differences in the rates of episodic memory (p = 0.23) or overall cognitive change (p = 0.90) were detected. In the CSF subsample, APOE2 carriers had higher levels of CSF Abeta (p = 0.01), lower p-tau (p = 0.02), and marginally lower tau (p = 0.12). CONCLUSION: A slower rate of hippocampal atrophy in normal APOE2 carriers is consistent with the lower risk of Alzheimer disease in these individuals. We hypothesize that the slower atrophy rate is related to decreased preclinical Alzheimer pathology. :: Notes: Chiang, G C :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20980669 :: Author Address: Department of Radiology, University of California at San Francisco, 505 Parnassus Avenue M-391, San Francisco, CA 94143, USA. gloria.chiang@radiology.ucsf.edu

METHODS: Baseline and 12-month follow-up neuropsychological and morphometric measures were examined for healthy control subjects and patients with AD. The two AD groups were divided further into subgroups on the basis of the presence of at least one APOE epsilon4 allele. RESULTS: The YOAD group showed more severe deficits and steeper declines in cognition than the VOAD group. Moreover, the presence of an APOE epsilon4 allele had a more deleterious effect on the YOAD group than the VOAD group on cognition and brain structure both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.

METHODS: We measured markers of amyloid pathology (CSF beta-amyloid 42) and neurodegeneration (hippocampal volume on MRI and cortical metabolism on [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET) in 201 patients with MCI clinically followed for up to 6 years to detect progressive cognitive deterioration. We categorized patients with MCI as A+/A- and N+/N- based on presence/absence of amyloid pathology and neurodegeneration. SNAPs were A-N+ cases. RESULTS: The proportion of progressors was 11% (8/41), 34% (14/41), 56% (19/34), and 71% (60/85) in A-N-, A+N-, SNAP, and A+N+, respectively; the proportion of APOE epsilon4 carriers was 29%, 70%, 31%, and 71%, respectively, with the SNAP group featuring a significantly different proportion than both A+N- and A+N+ groups (p </= 0.005). Hypometabolism in SNAP patients was comparable to A+N+ patients (p = 0.154), while hippocampal atrophy was more severe in SNAP patients (p = 0.002). Compared with A-N-, SNAP and A+N+ patients had significant risk of progressive cognitive deterioration (hazard ratio = 2.7 and 3.8, p = 0.016 and p < 0.001), while A+N- patients did not (hazard ratio = 1.13, p = 0.771). In A+N- and A+N+ groups, none of the biomarkers predicted time to progression. In the SNAP group, lower time to progression was correlated with greater hypometabolism (r = 0.42, p = 0.073). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the notion that patients with SNAP MCI feature a specific risk progression profile. :: Notes: Caroli, Anna :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25568301 :: Author Address: From the Medical Imaging Unit (A.C.), Biomedical Engineering Department, IRCCS Istituto di Ricerche Farmacologiche Mario Negri, Bergamo; LENITEM-Laboratory of Epidemiology Neuroimaging and Telemedicine (A.P., S.G., C.F., A.R., G.B.F.), IRCCS Centro San Giovanni di Dio Fatebenefratelli, Brescia, Italy; Alzheimer Center and Department of Neurology (W.M.v.d.F., R.O., P.S.), Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics (W.M.v.d.F.), Department of Radiology & Nuclear Medicine (B.V.B., F.B.), and Neurochemistry Laboratorium and Biobank, Department of Clinical Chemistry (C.T.), VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; PET-Center (A.E.W.), Section of Nuclear Medicine & PET, Department of Radiology, Oncology and Radiation Sciences, Uppsala University; Alzheimer Neurobiology Center (S.F.C., M.S., I.H.C., A.N.), Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden; Wolfson Molecular Imaging Centre (S.F.C.), University of Manchester, UK; MedTech West (M.S.), Sahlgrenska University Hospital, University of Gothenburg, Sweden; Department of Neuropsychiatry (I.H.C.), School of Medicine, Chosun University, Gwangju, Republic of Korea; Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (T.G.), Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technische Universitat Muenchen, Germany; Department of Geriatric Medicine (A.N.), Karolinska University Hospital Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden; Department of Nuclear Medicine (A.D.), University of Cologne, Germany; and Departments of Internal Medicine and Psychiatry (G.B.F.), University Hospitals and University of Geneva, Switzerland.

Two hundred twenty-nine cognitively healthy subjects, 154 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients converted to AD, and 193 (95 early and 98 late) AD patients were selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. For each biomarker, individual values were Z-transformed and plotted against ADAS-cog scores, and sigmoid and linear fits were compared. For most biomarkers the sigmoid model fitted data significantly better than the linear model. Abeta 1-42 time course followed a steep curve, stabilizing early in the disease course. CSF tau and hippocampal volume changed later showing similar monotonous trends, reflecting disease progression. Hippocampal loss trend was steeper and occurred earlier in time in APOE epsilon4 carriers than in non-carriers. FDG-PET started changing early in time and likely followed a linear decline. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence in favor of the dynamic biomarker model which has recently been proposed. :: Notes: Caroli, A :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20538373 :: Author Address: LENITEM Laboratory of Epidemiology, Neuroimaging and Telemedicine, IRCCS S.

Therefore, this study assessed the strength of association between localized HP atrophy measures and AD-related measures including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid beta and tau concentrations, and cognitive performance, in statistical models that also included total HP volume as a covariate. A computational technique termed localized components analysis (LoCA) was used to identify 7 independent patterns of HP atrophy among 390 semiautomatically delineated HP from baseline magnetic resonance imaging of participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Among cognitively normal participants, multiple measures of localized HP atrophy were significantly associated with CSF amyloid concentration, while total HP volume was not. In addition, among all participants, localized HP atrophy measures and total HP volume were both independently and additively associated with CSF tau concentration, performance on numerous neuropsychological tests, and discrimination between normal, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD clinical diagnostic groups. Together, these results suggest that regional measures of hippocampal atrophy provided by localized components analysis may be more sensitive than total HP volume to the effects of AD pathology burden among cognitively normal individuals and may provide information about HP regions whose deficits may have especially profound cognitive consequences throughout the AD clinical course. :: Notes: Carmichael, Owen :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22169204 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, School of Medicine, University of California, Davis, Davis, CA, USA. ocarmichael@ucdavis.edu

The assessment of the metabolic relationship among brain regions has the potential to provide unique information regarding the disease process. Previous studies of metabolic correlation patterns have demonstrated alterations in AD subjects relative to age-matched, healthy control subjects. The objective of this study was to examine the associations between beta-amyloid, apolipoprotein E varepsilon4 (APOE varepsilon4) genotype, and metabolic correlations patterns in subjects diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Mild cognitive impairment subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study were categorized into beta-amyloid-low and beta-amyloid-high groups, based on quantitative analysis of [18F]florbetapir PET scans, and APOE varepsilon4 non-carriers and carriers based on genotyping. We generated voxel-wise metabolic correlation strength maps across the entire cerebral cortex for each group, and, subsequently, performed a seed-based analysis. We found that the APOE varepsilon4 genotype was closely related to regional glucose hypometabolism, while elevated, fibrillar beta-amyloid burden was associated with specific derangements of the metabolic correlation patterns. :: Notes: Carbonell, Felix :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24736891 :: Author Address: Biospective Inc., 6100 avenue Royalmount, Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

We propose a versatile likelihood ratio test that allows joint testing for mean and variance heterogeneity (LRT(MV)) or either effect alone (LRT(M) or LRT(V)) in the presence of covariates. Using extensive simulations for our method and others, we found that all parametric tests were sensitive to nonnormality regardless of any trait transformations. Coupling our test with the parametric bootstrap solves this issue. Using simulations and empirical data from a known mean-only functional variant, we demonstrate how LD can produce variance-heterogeneity loci (vQTL) in a predictable fashion based on differential allele frequencies, high D', and relatively low r(2) values. We propose that a joint test for mean and variance heterogeneity is more powerful than a variance-only test for detecting vQTL. This takes advantage of loci that also have mean effects without sacrificing much power to detect variance only effects. We discuss using vQTL as an approach to detect G x G interactions and also how vQTL are related to relationship loci, and how both can create prior hypothesis for each other and reveal the relationships between traits and possibly between components of a composite trait. :: Notes: Cao, Ying :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24482837 ::

Early identification of patients at risk of developing AD is now becoming an international priority. Neocortical Abeta (extracellular beta-amyloid) burden (NAB), as assessed by positron emission tomography (PET), represents one such marker for early identification. These scans are expensive and are not widely available, thus, there is a need for cheaper and more widely accessible alternatives. Addressing this need, a blood biomarker-based signature having efficacy for the prediction of NAB and which can be easily adapted for population screening is described. Blood data (176 analytes measured in plasma) and Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB)-PET measurements from 273 participants from the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study were utilised. Univariate analysis was conducted to assess the difference of plasma measures between high and low NAB groups, and cross-validated machine-learning models were generated for predicting NAB. These models were applied to 817 non-imaged AIBL subjects and 82 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) for validation. Five analytes showed significant difference between subjects with high compared to low NAB. A machine-learning model (based on nine markers) achieved sensitivity and specificity of 80 and 82%, respectively, for predicting NAB. Validation using the ADNI cohort yielded similar results (sensitivity 79% and specificity 76%). These results show that a panel of blood-based biomarkers is able to accurately predict NAB, supporting the hypothesis for a relationship between a blood-based signature and Abeta accumulation, therefore, providing a platform for developing a population-based screen. :: Notes: Burnham, S C :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23628985 :: Author Address: CSIRO Preventative Health Flagship: Mathematics, Informatics and Statistics, Perth, WA, Australia.

Although some phenotypic measures are highly heritable in twin studies, SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) account for only a small fraction of the heritability of these measures. We mapped the genetic variation (the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by variation among SNPs) of volumes of pre-defined regions across the whole brain, as explained by 512,905 SNPs genotyped on 747 adult participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We found that 85% of the variance of intracranial volume (ICV) (p = 0.04) was explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously, and after adjusting for ICV, total grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM) volumes had genetic variation estimates near zero (p = 0.5). We found varying estimates of genetic variation across 93 non-overlapping regions, with asymmetry in estimates between the left and right cerebral hemispheres. Several regions reported in previous studies to be related to Alzheimer's disease progression were estimated to have a large proportion of volumetric variance explained by the SNPs. :: Notes: Bryant, Christopher :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24015190 :: Author Address: Department of Biostatistics, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, United States of America.

Hypotheses about the nature of the episodic memory declines in these diseases, about decline versus sparing of specific processes, and about which individuals will become impaired over time can all be rigorously tested. Basic theoretical principles, such as whether recollection and reconstruction are distinct retrieval processes, can also be evaluated. In 3 studies, measurements of recollective retrieval, reconstructive retrieval, and familiarity judgment were extracted from standard clinical instruments, for healthy subjects and for subjects with MCI and AD diagnoses. Differences in reconstructive retrieval consistently distinguished MCI and AD, in nationally representative subject samples as well as in highly educated samples, and recollective retrieval also distinguished them in highly educated samples. Dual-retrieval processes were accurate predictors of future conversion to MCI and AD over periods of 1.5-6 years and were better predictors than the best genetic marker of these conditions (the epsilon4 allele of the APOE genotype). The standard recollection-deficit account of memory declines in MCI and AD was not supported, but the data were consistent with an alternative account that stresses the increasing importance of reconstruction deficits as older adults convert to these diseases. :: Notes: Brainerd, C J :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23978235 :: Author Address: Department of Human Development, Cornell University.

The earliest studies focused on the volume of particular brain structures, such as hippocampus and entorhinal cortex. Even though volumetry is a powerful, robust and intuitive technique that has yielded a wealth of findings, more complex shape descriptors have been used to perform statistical shape analysis of particular brain structures. However, in shape analysis studies of brain structures the information of the relative pose between neighbor structures is typically disregarded. This work presents a framework to analyse pose information including the following approaches: similarity transformations with either pseudo-Riemannian or left-invariant Riemannian metric, and centered transformations with a bi-invariant Riemannian metric.

RESULTS: Overall, individuals with at least one APOE-epsilon2 allele showed less functional decline over time and better performance on neuropsychological measures than those without an epsilon2 allele, even after controlling for potential confounders. When diagnostic groups were examined individually, presence of the epsilon2 allele continued to be associated with slower functional decline, although the relationship was no longer statistically significant in most cases, likely due to reduced statistical power. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the APOE-epsilon2 allele provides a buffer against significant changes in daily functioning over time and is associated with better neuropsychological performance across a number of measures. :: Notes: Bonner-Jackson, Aaron :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21685781 :: Author Address: Warren Alpert Medical School of Brown University and Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI 02903, USA. abonnerjackson@lifespan.org

Resulting cluster groups were then compared and further examined for APOE allelic frequencies, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker levels, and clinical outcomes. Results revealed that both criteria produced a mildly impaired Amnestic subtype and a more severely impaired Dysexecutive/Mixed subtype. The neuropsychological Jak/Bondi criteria uniquely yielded a third Impaired Language subtype, whereas conventional Petersen/Winblad ADNI criteria produced a third subtype comprising nearly one-third of the sample that performed within normal limits across the cognitive measures, suggesting this method's susceptibility to false positive diagnoses. MCI participants diagnosed via neuropsychological criteria yielded dissociable cognitive phenotypes, significant CSF AD biomarker associations, more stable diagnoses, and identified greater percentages of participants who progressed to dementia than conventional MCI diagnostic criteria. Importantly, the actuarial neuropsychological method did not produce a subtype that performed within normal limits on the cognitive testing, unlike the conventional diagnostic method. Findings support the need for refinement of MCI diagnoses to incorporate more comprehensive neuropsychological methods, with resulting gains in empirical characterization of specific cognitive phenotypes, biomarker associations, stability of diagnoses, and prediction of progression. Refinement of MCI diagnostic methods may also yield gains in biomarker and clinical trial study findings because of improvements in sample compositions of 'true positive' cases and removal of 'false positive' cases. :: Notes: Bondi, Mark W :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24844687 :: Author Address: Veterans Affairs San Diego Healthcare System, San Diego, CA, USA Department of Psychiatry, University of California San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, CA, USA.

In Stage I, all suggestive single-nucleotide polymorphisms (at P<0.001) in a previously reported GWAS of seven independent studies (8082 Alzheimer/'s disease (AD) cases; 12[thinsp]040 controls) were selected, and in Stage II these were examined in an in silico analysis within the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology consortium GWAS (1367 cases and 12904 controls). Six novel signals reaching P<5 [times] 10-6 were genotyped in an independent Stage III sample (the Fundacio ACE data set) of 2200 sporadic AD patients and 2301 controls. We identified a novel association with AD in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase, H+ transporting, mitochondrial F0 (ATP5H)/Potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing protein 2 (KCTD2) locus, which reached genome-wide significance in the combined discovery and genotyping sample (rs11870474, odds ratio (OR)=1.58, P=2.6 [times] 10-7 in discovery and OR=1.43, P=0.004 in Fundacio ACE data set; combined OR=1.53, P=4.7 [times] 10-9). This ATP5H/KCTD2 locus has an important function in mitochondrial energy production and neuronal hyperpolarization during cellular stress conditions, such as hypoxia or glucose deprivation. :: Notes: Supplementary information available for this article at http://www.nature.com/mp/journal/v19/n6/suppinfo/mp201386s1.html :: URL: http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/mp.2013.86 ::

Our genome-wide association study (GWAS) of dementia-free persons (n = 9,232) identified 46 SNPs at four loci with P values of <4.0 x 10(-7). In two additional samples (n = 2,318), associations were replicated at 12q14 within MSRB3-WIF1 (discovery and replication; rs17178006; P = 5.3 x 10(-11)) and at 12q24 near HRK-FBXW8 (rs7294919; P = 2.9 x 10(-11)). Remaining associations included one SNP at 2q24 within DPP4 (rs6741949; P = 2.9 x 10(-7)) and nine SNPs at 9p33 within ASTN2 (rs7852872; P = 1.0 x 10(-7)); along with the chromosome 12 associations, these loci were also associated with hippocampal volume (P < 0.05) in a third younger, more heterogeneous sample (n = 7,794). The SNP in ASTN2 also showed suggestive association with decline in cognition in a largely independent sample (n = 1,563). These associations implicate genes related to apoptosis (HRK), development (WIF1), oxidative stress (MSR3B), ubiquitination (FBXW8) and neuronal migration (ASTN2), as well as enzymes targeted by new diabetes medications (DPP4), indicating new genetic influences on hippocampal size and possibly the risk of cognitive decline and dementia. :: Notes: Bis, Joshua C :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22504421 :: Author Address: Cardiovascular Health Research Unit, Department of Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, USA.

We sought to test whether genetic variants within OXPHOS genes increase the risk of AD. We first used gene-set enrichment analysis to identify associations, and then applied a previously replicated stroke genetic risk score to determine if OXPHOS genetic overlap exists between stroke and AD. Gene-set enrichment analysis identified associations between variation in OXPHOS genes and AD versus control status (p = 0.012). Conversion from cognitively normal controls to mild cognitive impairment was also associated with the OXPHOS gene-set (p = 0.045). Subset analyses demonstrated association for complex I genes (p < 0.05), but not for complexes II-V. Among neuroimaging measures, hippocampal volume and entorhinal cortex thickness were associated with OXPHOS genes (all p < 0.025). The stroke genetic risk score demonstrated association with clinical status, baseline and longitudinal imaging measures (p < 0.05). OXPHOS genetic variation influences clinical status and neuroimaging intermediates of AD. OXPHOS genetic variants associated with stroke are also linked to AD progression. Further studies are needed to explore functional consequences of these OXPHOS variants. :: Notes: Biffi, Alessandro :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24650791 :: Author Address: Division of Neurocritical Care and Emergency Neurology, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; Center for Human Genetic Research, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA; Program in Medical and Population Genetics, Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, USA.

DESIGN: Multicenter case-control study of genetic and neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. SETTING: Multicenter GWAS. Patients A total of 168 individuals with probable AD, 357 with mild cognitive impairment, and 215 cognitively normal control individuals recruited from more than 50 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative centers in the United States and Canada. All study participants had APOE and genome-wide genetic data available. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We investigated the influence of GWAS-validated and GWAS-promising novel AD loci on hippocampal volume, amygdala volume, white matter lesion volume, entorhinal cortex thickness, parahippocampal gyrus thickness, and temporal pole cortex thickness. RESULTS: Markers at the APOE locus were associated with all phenotypes except white matter lesion volume (all false discovery rate-corrected P values < .001). Novel and established AD loci identified by prior GWASs showed a significant cumulative score-based effect (false discovery rate P = .04) on all analyzed neuroimaging measures. The GWAS-validated variants at the CR1 and PICALM loci and markers at 2 novel loci (BIN1 and CNTN5) showed association with multiple magnetic resonance imaging characteristics (false discovery rate P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Loci associated with AD also influence neuroimaging correlates of this disease. Furthermore, neuroimaging analysis identified 2 additional loci of high interest for further study. :: Notes: Biffi, Alessandro :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20558387 :: Author Address: Center for Human Genetic Research, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, USA.

One of the most consistently replicated of these putative obesity genes is fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO). A recent study by investigators from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative set out to assess whether polymorphisms in FTO are directly correlated with brain volume in a collection of over 200 healthy older individuals. The authors found a modest but significant reduction in brain volume in the frontal and occipital lobes exerted by the same FTO alleles that also predispose to obesity. Although potentially providing a novel genetic link between obesity and brain structure, the relevance of these findings for normal brain function and disease remains to be determined. :: Notes: Bertram, Lars :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20875147 :: Author Address: Neuropsychiatric Genetics Group, Max-Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Ihnestrasse 63, Room 204,1, 14195 Berlin, Germany. lbertram@molgen.mpg.de.

In this study, we performed deep sequencing of APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, GRN, APOE and MAPT genes in individuals with extreme CSF Abeta42, tau, or ptau levels. One known pathogenic mutation (PSEN1 p.A426P), four high-risk variants for AD (APOE p.L46P, MAPT p.A152T, PSEN2 p.R62H and p.R71W) and nine novel variants were identified. Surprisingly, a coding variant in PSEN1, p.E318G (rs17125721-G) exhibited a significant association with high CSF tau (p = 9.2 x 10(-4)) and ptau (p = 1.8 x 10(-3)) levels. The association of the p.E318G variant with Abeta deposition was observed in APOE-epsilon4 allele carriers. Furthermore, we found that in a large case-control series (n = 5,161) individuals who are APOE-epsilon4 carriers and carry the p.E318G variant are at a risk of developing AD (OR = 10.7, 95% CI = 4.7-24.6) that is similar to APOE-epsilon4 homozygous (OR = 9.9, 95% CI = 7.2.9-13.6), and double the risk for APOE-epsilon4 carriers that do not carry p.E318G (OR = 3.9, 95% CI = 3.4-4.4). The p.E318G variant is present in 5.3% (n = 30) of the families from a large clinical series of LOAD families (n = 565) and exhibited a higher frequency in familial LOAD (MAF = 2.5%) than in sporadic LOAD (MAF = 1.6%) (p = 0.02). Additionally, we found that in the presence of at least one APOE-epsilon4 allele, p.E318G is associated with more Abeta plaques and faster cognitive decline. We demonstrate that the effect of PSEN1, p.E318G on AD susceptibility is largely dependent on an interaction with APOE-epsilon4 and mediated by an increased burden of Abeta deposition. :: Notes: Benitez, Bruno A :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23990795 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry, School of Medicine, Washington University, St Louis, Missouri, United States of America.

Recent studies have identified a rare coding variant (p.R47H) in TREM2 that confers a high risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In addition, common single nucleotide polymorphisms in this genomic region are associated with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers for AD and a common intergenic variant found near the TREML2 gene has been identified to be protective for AD. However, little is known about the functional variant underlying the latter association or its relationship with the p.R47H. Here, we report comprehensive analyses using whole-exome sequencing data, cerebrospinal fluid biomarker analyses, meta-analyses (16,254 cases and 20,052 controls) and cell-based functional studies to support the role of the TREML2 coding missense variant p.S144G (rs3747742) as a potential driver of the meta-analysis AD-associated genome-wide association studies signal. Additionally, we demonstrate that the protective role of TREML2 in AD is independent of the role of TREM2 gene as a risk factor for AD. :: Notes: Benitez, Bruno A :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24439484 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, USA.

Traditionally, imaging genetics methods comprise two separate steps. First, image features are selected based on their relevance to the disease phenotype. Second, a set of genetic variants are identified to explain the selected features. In contrast, our method performs these tasks simultaneously to ultimately assign probabilistic measures of relevance to both genetic and imaging markers. We derive an efficient approximate inference algorithm that handles high dimensionality of imaging genetic data. We evaluate the algorithm on synthetic data and show that it outperforms traditional models. We also illustrate the application of the method on ADNI data. © 2013 Springer-Verlag. :: Notes: Conference code: 97746 :: URL: http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84879867440&partnerID=40&md5=2cb63aec748a95fa60076c85c31f5245 :: Author Address: Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, MIT, Cambridge, MA, United States

However, it is still largely unknown what specific genetic and environmental factors contribute to normal variation in the area of visual cortex. To identify SNPs associated with the proportional surface area of visual cortex, we performed a genome-wide association study followed by replication in two independent cohorts. We identified one SNP (rs6116869) that replicated in both cohorts and had genome-wide significant association (P(combined) = 3.2 x 10(-8)). Furthermore, a metaanalysis of imputed SNPs in this genomic region identified a more significantly associated SNP (rs238295; P = 6.5 x 10(-9)) that was in strong linkage disequilibrium with rs6116869. These SNPs are located within 4 kb of the 5' UTR of GPCPD1, glycerophosphocholine phosphodiesterase GDE1 homolog (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which in humans, is more highly expressed in occipital cortex compared with the remainder of cortex than 99.9% of genes genome-wide. Based on these findings, we conclude that this common genetic variation contributes to the proportional area of human visual cortex. We suggest that identifying genes that contribute to normal cortical architecture provides a first step to understanding genetic mechanisms that underlie visual perception. :: Notes: Bakken, Trygve E :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22343285 :: Author Address: Medical Scientist Training Program, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA.

However, the relationship between specific brain morphology and genetically-determined ancestry is largely unknown. METHODS: We used two independent data sets to characterize variation in skull and brain morphology among individuals of European ancestry. The first data set is a historical sample of 1,170 male skulls with 37 shape measurements drawn from 27 European populations. The second data set includes 626 North American individuals of European ancestry participating in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) with magnetic resonance imaging, height and weight, neurological diagnosis, and genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. RESULTS: We found that both skull and brain morphological variation exhibit a population-genetic fingerprint among individuals of European ancestry. This fingerprint shows a Northwest to Southeast gradient, is independent of body size, and involves frontotemporal cortical regions. CONCLUSION: Our findings are consistent with prior evidence for gene flow in Europe due to historical population movements and indicate that genetic background should be considered in studies seeking to identify genes involved in human cortical development and neuropsychiatric disease. :: Notes: Bakken, Trygve E :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21849792 :: Author Address: The Scripps Translational Science Institute, La Jolla, Calif., USA.

Methods: The subject groups for model derivation comprised 80 healthy subjects (HS), 36 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who converted to AD dementia within 18 months, 85 non-converter MCI patients who did not convert within 24 months, and 67 AD dementia patients with baseline FDG PET scan were recruited from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Additionally, baseline FDG PET scans from 20 HS, 27 MCI and 21 AD dementia patients from our institutional cohort were included for model validation. The analysis technique was designed on the basis of the AD-related hypometabolic convergence index adapted for our laboratory-specific context (AD-PET index), and combined in a multivariable model with age and gender for AD dementia detection (AD score). A logistic regression analysis of different cortical PET indexes and clinical variables was applied to search for relevant predictive factors to include in the multivariable model for the prediction of MCI conversion to AD dementia (AD-Conv score). The resultant scores were stratified into sixtiles for probabilistic diagnosis. Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the AD score detecting AD dementia in the ADNI database was 0.879, and the observed probability of AD dementia in the six defined groups ranged from 8 % to 100 % in a monotonic trend. For predicting MCI conversion to AD dementia, only the posterior cingulate index, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score and apolipoprotein E4 genotype (ApoE4) exhibited significant independent effects in the univariable and multivariable models. When only the latter two clinical variables were included in the model, the AUC was 0.742 (95 % CI 0.646 - 0.838), but this increased to 0.804 (95 % CI 0.714 - 0.894, bootstrap p = 0.027) with the addition of the posterior cingulate index (AD-Conv score). Baseline clinical diagnosis of MCI showed 29.7 % of converters after 18 months. The observed probability of conversion in relation to baseline AD-Conv score was 75 % in the high probability group (sixtile 6), 34 % in the medium probability group (merged sixtiles 4 and 5), 20 % in the low probability group (sixtile 3) and 7.5 % in the very low probability group (merged sixtiles 1 and 2). In the validation population, the AD score reached an AUC of 0.948 (95 % CI 0.625 - 0.969) and the AD-Conv score reached 0.968 (95 % CI 0.908 - 1.000), with AD patients and MCI converters included in the highest probability categories. Conclusion: Posterior cingulate hypometabolism, when combined in a multivariable model with age and gender as well as MMSE score and ApoE4 data, improved the determination of the likelihood of patients with MCI converting to AD dementia compared with clinical variables alone. The probabilistic model described here provides a new tool that may aid in the clinical diagnosis of AD and MCI conversion. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. :: Notes: Cited By (since 1996):1 :: URL: http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-84881670522&partnerID=40&md5=6c98e6bd8db42ac625ec60dcbec34831 :: Author Address: Department of Nuclear Medicine, Clínica Universidad de Navarra, Avenida Pio XII 36, 31008 Pamplona, Spain

Clinical :: ISSN: 2213-1582 (Electronic) :: PMCID: 3952354 :: Accession Number: 24634832 :: Abstract: Biomarkers are the only feasible way to detect and monitor presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD). No single biomarker can predict future cognitive decline with an acceptable level of accuracy. In addition to designing powerful multimodal diagnostic platforms, a careful investigation of the major sources of disease heterogeneity and their influence on biomarker changes is needed. Here we investigated the accuracy of a novel multimodal biomarker classifier for differentiating cognitively normal (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects with and without stratification by ApoE4 genotype. 111 NC, 182 MCI and 95 AD ADNI participants provided both structural MRI and CSF data at baseline. We used an automated machine-learning classifier to test the ability of hippocampal volume and CSF Abeta, t-tau and p-tau levels, both separately and in combination, to differentiate NC, MCI and AD subjects, and predict conversion. We hypothesized that the combined hippocampal/CSF biomarker classifier model would achieve the highest accuracy in differentiating between the three diagnostic groups and that ApoE4 genotype will affect both diagnostic accuracy and biomarker selection. The combined hippocampal/CSF classifier performed better than hippocampus-only classifier in differentiating NC from MCI and NC from AD. It also outperformed the CSF-only classifier in differentiating NC vs. AD. Our amyloid marker played a role in discriminating NC from MCI or AD but not for MCI vs. AD. Neurodegenerative markers contributed to accurate discrimination of AD from NC and MCI but not NC from MCI. Classifiers predicting MCI conversion performed well only after ApoE4 stratification. Hippocampal volume and sex achieved AUC = 0.68 for predicting conversion in the ApoE4-positive MCI, while CSF p-tau, education and sex achieved AUC = 0.89 for predicting conversion in ApoE4-negative MCI. These observations support the proposed biomarker trajectory in AD, which postulates that amyloid markers become abnormal early in the disease course while markers of neurodegeneration become abnormal later in the disease course and suggests that ApoE4 could be at least partially responsible for some of the observed disease heterogeneity. :: Notes: Apostolova, Liana G :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24634832 :: Author Address: Department of Neurology, David Geffen School of Medicine, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

METHODS: We developed a multimodal biomarker classifier for predicting brain amyloidosis using cognitive, imaging, and peripheral blood protein ADNI1 MCI data. We used CSF beta-amyloid 1-42 (Abeta42) </=192 pg/mL as proxy measure for Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET standard uptake value ratio >/=1.5. We trained our classifier in the subcohort with CSF Abeta42 but no PiB-PET data and tested its performance in the subcohort with PiB-PET but no CSF Abeta42 data. We also examined the utility of our biomarker signature for predicting disease progression from MCI to Alzheimer dementia. RESULTS: The CSF training classifier selected Mini-Mental State Examination, Trails B, Auditory Verbal Learning Test delayed recall, education, APOE genotype, interleukin 6 receptor, clusterin, and ApoE protein, and achieved leave-one-out accuracy of 85% (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.8). The PiB testing classifier achieved an AUC of 0.72, and when classifier self-tuning was allowed, AUC = 0.74. The 36-month disease-progression classifier achieved AUC = 0.75 and accuracy = 71%. CONCLUSIONS: Automated classifiers based on cognitive and peripheral blood protein variables can identify the presence of brain amyloidosis with a modest level of accuracy. Such methods could have implications for clinical trial design and enrollment in the near future. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that a classification algorithm based on cognitive, imaging, and peripheral blood protein measures identifies patients with brain amyloid on PiB-PET with moderate accuracy (sensitivity 68%, specificity 78%). :: Notes: Apostolova, Liana G :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25609767 :: Author Address: From the Departments of Neurology (L.G.A., K.S.H., D.A., O.K., E.T., P.M.T.), Medicine Statistics Core (D.E.), and School of Nursing (S.S.), David Geffen School of Medicine at University of California, Los Angeles; Institute for Neuroinformatics (P.M.T.), Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles; Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System (E.T.); Department of Diagnostic Radiology (C.R.J.), Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN; Department of Public Health and Neuroscience (W.J.J.), University of California, Berkeley; Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine (L.S., J.Q.T.), University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia; Department of Radiology (M.W.W.), University of California, San Francisco; and Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center (M.W.W.), San Francisco, CA. lapostolova@mednet.ucla.edu.

METHODS: We genotyped 1,128 individuals using the Affymetrix Nsp I 250K chip. A sample of 327 sporadic AD patients and 801 controls with unknown cognitive status from the Spanish general population were included in our initial study. To increase the power of the study, we combined our results with those of four other public GWAS datasets by applying identical quality control filters and the same imputation methods, which were then analyzed with a global meta-GWAS. A replication sample with 2,200 sporadic AD patients and 2,301 controls was genotyped to confirm our GWAS findings.

Case-control studies suggest the APOE4 link to AD is stronger in women. We examined the APOE4-by-sex interaction in conversion risk (from healthy aging to mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/AD or from MCI to AD) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker levels. METHODS: Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to compute hazard ratios (HRs) for an APOE-by-sex interaction on conversion in controls (n = 5,496) and MCI patients (n = 2,588). The interaction was also tested in CSF biomarker levels of 980 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. RESULTS: Among controls, male and female carriers were more likely to convert to MCI/AD, but the effect was stronger in women (HR = 1.81 for women; HR = 1.27 for men; interaction: p = 0.011). The interaction remained significant in a predefined subanalysis restricted to APOE3/3 and APOE3/4 genotypes. Among MCI patients, both male and female APOE4 carriers were more likely to convert to AD (HR = 2.16 for women; HR = 1.64 for men); the interaction was not significant (p = 0.14). In the subanalysis restricted to APOE3/3 and APOE3/4 genotypes, the interaction was significant (p = 0.02; HR = 2.17 for women; HR = 1.51 for men). The APOE4-by-sex interaction on biomarker levels was significant for MCI patients for total tau and the tau-to-Abeta ratio (p = 0.009 and p = 0.02, respectively; more AD-like in women). INTERPRETATION: APOE4 confers greater AD risk in women. Biomarker results suggest that increased APOE-related risk in women may be associated with tau pathology. These findings have important clinical implications and suggest novel research approaches into AD pathogenesis. :: Notes: Altmann, Andre :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24623176 :: Author Address: Stanford Center for Memory Disorders, Department of Neurology and Neurological Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, CA.

The overall chance-corrected agreement was poor (Cohen kappa, 0.24-0.34), in accord with a high rate of conflicting findings (26%-41%). Neither diagnosis nor APOE epsilon4 status significantly influenced the distribution of agreement between the biomarkers. The degree of agreement tended to be higher in individuals with abnormal versus normal CSF beta-amyloid (Abeta1-42) levels. Prospective diagnostic criteria for AD should address the relative importance of markers of neuronal injury and elaborate a way of dealing with conflicting biomarker findings. :: Notes: Alexopoulos, Panagiotis :: URL: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24857233 :: Author Address: Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Technische Universitat Munchen, Munich, Germany; Department of Psychiatry, University of Patras, Rion Patras, Greece.

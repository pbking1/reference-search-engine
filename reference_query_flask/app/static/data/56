Abstract: BACKGROUND: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 allele's role as a modulator of the relationship between soluble plasma amyloid beta (Abeta) and fibrillar brain Abeta measured by Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography ([(11)C]PiB PET) has not been assessed. METHODS: Ninety-six Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative participants with [(11)C]PiB scans and plasma Abeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 measurements at the time of PET scanning were included. Regional and voxelwise analyses of [(11)C]PiB data were used to determine the influence of APOE epsilon4 allele on association of plasma Abeta1-40, Abeta1-42, and Abeta1-40/Abeta1-42 with [(11)C]PiB uptake. RESULTS: In APOE epsilon4- but not epsilon4+ participants, positive relationships between plasma Abeta1-40/Abeta1-42 and [(11)C]PiB uptake were observed. Modeling the interaction of APOE and plasma Abeta1-40/Abeta1-42 improved the explained variance in [(11)C]PiB binding compared with using APOE and plasma Abeta1-40/Abeta1-42 as separate terms. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that plasma Abeta is a potential Alzheimer's disease biomarker and highlight the importance of genetic variation in interpretation of plasma Abeta levels.

Abstract: Complement receptor 1 gene polymorphism rs3818361 was recently shown to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We performed an independent replication study of this genetic variant in 2,470 individuals from Spain. By applying an allelic model, we observed a trend toward an association between this marker and late-onset AD susceptibility in our case-control study (odds ratio = 1.114, 95% confidence interval: 0.958-1.296, P = .16). Meta-analysis of available studies (n = 31,771 individuals), including previous studies and public genome-wide association study resources (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, Translational Genomics Research Institute, and Multi-site Collaborative Study for Genotype-Phenotype Associations in Alzheimer's Disease), strongly supports the effect of rs3818361 (odds ratio = 1.180, 95% confidence interval: 1.113-1.252, P < 2.99E-8) and suggests the existence of between-study heterogeneity (P < .05). We concluded that the complement receptor 1 gene may contribute to AD risk, although its effect size could be smaller than previously estimated.

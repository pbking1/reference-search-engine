Abstract: Biomarkers associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like brain atrophy in healthy individuals may identify mechanisms involved in early stage AD. Aside from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) beta-amyloid42 (Abeta42) and tau, no studies have tested associations between CSF proteins and AD-like brain atrophy. We studied 90 healthy elders, who underwent lumbar puncture at baseline, and serial magnetic resonance imaging scans for up to 4 years. We tested statistical effects of baseline CSF proteins (N = 70 proteins related to Abeta42-metabolism, microglial activity, and synaptic/neuronal function) on atrophy rates in 7 AD-related regions. Besides the effects of Abeta42 and phosphorylated tau (P-tau) that were seen in several regions, novel CSF proteins were found to have effects in inferior and middle temporal cortex (including apolipoprotein CIII, apolipoprotein D, and apolipoprotein H). Several proteins (including S100beta and matrix metalloproteinase-3) had effects that depended on the presence of brain Abeta pathology, as measured by CSF Abeta42. Other proteins (including P-tau and apolipoprotein D) had effects even after adjusting for CSF Abeta42. The statistical effects in this exploratory study were mild and not significant after correction for multiple comparisons, but some of the identified proteins may be associated with brain atrophy in healthy persons. Proteins interacting with CSF Abeta42 may be related to Abeta brain pathology, whereas proteins associated with atrophy even after adjusting for CSF Abeta42 may be related to Abeta-independent mechanisms.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study examined the predictive value of different classes of markers in the progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) over an extended 4-year follow-up in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. METHODS: MCI patients were assessed for clinical, cognitive, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography-fluorodeoxyglucose (PET-FDG), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) markers at baseline and were followed on a yearly basis for 4 years to ascertain progression to AD. Logistic regression models were fitted in clusters, including demographics, APOE genotype, cognitive markers, and biomarkers (morphometric, PET-FDG, CSF, amyloid-beta, and tau). RESULTS: The predictive model at 4 years revealed that two cognitive measures, an episodic memory measure and a Clock Drawing screening test, were the best predictors of conversion (area under the curve = 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: This model of prediction is consistent with the previous model at 2 years, thus highlighting the importance of cognitive measures in progression from MCI to AD. Cognitive markers were more robust predictors than biomarkers.

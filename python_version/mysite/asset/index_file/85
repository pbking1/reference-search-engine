Abstract: BACKGROUND: We introduced a hypometabolic convergence index (HCI) to characterize in a single measurement the extent to which a person's fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomogram (FDG PET) corresponds to that in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Apolipoprotein E epsilon4 (APOE epsilon4) gene dose is associated with three levels of risk for late-onset AD. We explored the association between gene dose and HCI in cognitively normal epsilon4 homozygotes, heterozygotes, and non-carriers. METHODS: An algorithm was used to characterize and compare AD-related HCIs in cognitively normal individuals, including 36 epsilon4 homozygotes, 46 heterozygotes, and 78 non-carriers. RESULTS: These three groups differed significantly in their HCIs (ANOVA, p = 0.004), and there was a significant association between HCIs and gene dose (linear trend, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The HCI is associated with three levels of genetic risk for late-onset AD. This supports the possibility of using a single FDG PET measurement to help in the preclinical detection and tracking of AD.

Abstract: The primary constituents of plaques (Abeta42/Abeta40) and neurofibrillary tangles (tau and phosphorylated forms of tau [ptau]) are the current leading diagnostic and prognostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for AD. In this study, we performed deep sequencing of APP, PSEN1, PSEN2, GRN, APOE and MAPT genes in individuals with extreme CSF Abeta42, tau, or ptau levels. One known pathogenic mutation (PSEN1 p.A426P), four high-risk variants for AD (APOE p.L46P, MAPT p.A152T, PSEN2 p.R62H and p.R71W) and nine novel variants were identified. Surprisingly, a coding variant in PSEN1, p.E318G (rs17125721-G) exhibited a significant association with high CSF tau (p = 9.2 x 10(-4)) and ptau (p = 1.8 x 10(-3)) levels. The association of the p.E318G variant with Abeta deposition was observed in APOE-epsilon4 allele carriers. Furthermore, we found that in a large case-control series (n = 5,161) individuals who are APOE-epsilon4 carriers and carry the p.E318G variant are at a risk of developing AD (OR = 10.7, 95% CI = 4.7-24.6) that is similar to APOE-epsilon4 homozygous (OR = 9.9, 95% CI = 7.2.9-13.6), and double the risk for APOE-epsilon4 carriers that do not carry p.E318G (OR = 3.9, 95% CI = 3.4-4.4). The p.E318G variant is present in 5.3% (n = 30) of the families from a large clinical series of LOAD families (n = 565) and exhibited a higher frequency in familial LOAD (MAF = 2.5%) than in sporadic LOAD (MAF = 1.6%) (p = 0.02). Additionally, we found that in the presence of at least one APOE-epsilon4 allele, p.E318G is associated with more Abeta plaques and faster cognitive decline. We demonstrate that the effect of PSEN1, p.E318G on AD susceptibility is largely dependent on an interaction with APOE-epsilon4 and mediated by an increased burden of Abeta deposition.
